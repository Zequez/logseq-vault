	- It's not Goal, Strategy, Tactic, Mission, Vision, Bucket List, or a Plan.
	- The background magnetic field that you source, establishing your orientation that emerges from who you are.
	- It indicates in every circumstances the direction North.
	- What you actually want and need in these exact circumstances.
	- An Unconscious Gameplan aims at mere Survival, implementing [[Unconscious Purpose]], your [[Gremlin]] [[Hidden Purpose]].
