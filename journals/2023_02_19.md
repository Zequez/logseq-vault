- The architecture is essentially "Just keep the page open so it updates"
- The business model is "you can give me a tip for keeping a page open for you"
- The prototype MVP is the following:
	- archy.site is the homepage/landing page of the project.
	- eze.archy.site is my website, my address on this particular server is eze.
	- On the global net, my address is ezequielschwartzman.org, which points to eze.archy.site; it displays the same content.
		- Likewise, notes.ezequielschwartzman.org points to notes.eze.archy.site
		- Aditionally ezequielschwartzman.org/some-subpage points to eze.archy.site/some-subpage
