- The architecture is essentially "Just keep the page open so it updates"
- The business model is "you can give me a tip for keeping a page open for you"
- The prototype MVP is the following:
	- archy.site is the homepage of the project.
	- eze.archy.site is my website, my address on this particular server is eze.
	- On the global net, my address is ezequielschwartzman.org, which points to eze.archy.
