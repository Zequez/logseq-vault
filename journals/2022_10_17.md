- [[Failing]]
- [[Anger at Loud Vehicles Passing By My Home]]
- [[Stop acting as if I know what I'm doing]]
- I feel very angry about how the journal pages in LogSeq are, I want them to scroll upwards (start on the bottom of the page, as if I'm writing on a long scroll)
- And I feel angry also about the fixed [[Gregorian Calendar]] date! I want it changed to the [[1320]] Sincronary.
