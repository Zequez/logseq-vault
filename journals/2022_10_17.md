- Publishing What I Write on LogSeq
	- Let's take on the identity of an Archan Hacker
	- I can make use of Microsoft infrastructure to host websites on Github for free. I can also host the raw LogSeq vault for free.
		- It as size limitations; but works well for experimenting.
		- I'm actually already hosting my LogSeq vault
	- I can create a subdirectory on the LogSeq vault that uses the LogSeq files directly to create a website (rather than "exporting" it as a website, it can be made so it works "on the fly")
		- Sort of like a LogSeq Publishing Daemon that takes your LogSeq vault and continuously generates a website from it that can be statically hosted anywhere.

		- Can use Vite
