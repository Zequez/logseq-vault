- Publishing What I Write on LogSeq
	- Let's take on the identity of an Archan Hacker
	- I make use of Microsoft infrastructure to host websites on Github for free. I also host the raw LogSeq vault for free.
		- It as size limitations; but works well for experimenting.
		- I'm actually already hosting [my LogSeq vault](https://github.com/Zequez/logseq-vault/) and publishing it [with the LogSeq UI](http://notes.zequez.space/)
			- I'm feeling very excited because I'm creating the UI that I want for the [[Stuff I Want to Change in LogSeq]] and testing it live in my personal website.
	- I create a subdirectory on the LogSeq vault that uses the LogSeq files directly to create a website (rather than "exporting" it as a website, it can be made so it works "on the fly")
		- Sort of like a LogSeq Publishing Daemon that takes your LogSeq vault and continuously generates a website from it that can be statically hosted anywhere.
		- Here I'm taking a shot at using [Astro](https://astro.build/) to generate the website.
			- I'm feeling anxious now, want to check messages, specially answer to [[Dawson]] . I'm somehow really convinced that he's a key to this.
	- It is possible to make the website time-travel and be able to see the website evolution over time.
