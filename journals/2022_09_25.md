- # Ecovillaging
	- Is a [[Practice]].
	- You can Practice Ecovillaging no matter where you are. Everyone is part of your village. Your village is the whole Earth. You don't have to wait until you are spending your days in the middle of a specific space of the Earth which a group of people are considered to have authority over it, to start living the holistic life you want. The life that is in resonance with your deepest held values.
	- This Practice is about living collaboratively, with other humans and all beings. About taking Radical Responsibility about everything that is happening in your village; the whole Earth. In you there is the power to rise up to the circumstances
