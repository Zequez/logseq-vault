	- Ezequiel would always come to you with the most uncomfortable questions; he did not care a bit to soften the blow; his insatiable curiosity was both a force of nature and a catalyst that took you by surprise and pulled the rug from below you.
	- He was always ready to serve with all his being; literally running when it was time to take action; always full of energy.
	- He would see the possibilities on every problem; problems were to him just a new game to play and enjoy.
	- He would bounce back from lows in an instant; you could see him crying one second, and next minute he was already over it. Never held a grudge, resentment would quickly fall off and he was already back at peace.
	- When he played he would be completely immersed; he would joyfully play with children without a care in the world.
