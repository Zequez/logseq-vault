- Hello village! I'm in dire need of cash for my next steps; I've been chiseling my way towards a collaborative web playground Gameworld contexted in Archiarchy and I'm nowhere near having a working thing.
- I'm a web programmer and I'm taking requests for anything really. I can do:
	- Web components that you can include in your websites
	- Entire websites
	-
	- Web apps that you can install in mobile phones
