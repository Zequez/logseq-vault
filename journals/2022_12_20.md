- Hello village! I'm in dire need of cash for my next steps; I've been chiseling my way towards a collaborative web playground Gameworld contexted in Archiarchy and I'm nowhere near having a working thing.
- I'm Web Native, I speak the languages of the web and I can bend it to my will
- I'm a web programmer and I'm taking requests for anything really. I can do:
	- Web components that you can include in existing websites
	- Entire websites or platforms
	- Webpages that you can add as subdomains to your existing websites
	- Web apps that you can install in mobile phones
	- I can connect anything with anything. For example, on this experiment the website accesses data from Google Sheets to generate content. I could do the same for other services or websites.
	- I can show you how to do any of these things and we can build together
- I can in theory create anything that runs on the web, so just ask me and I shall
- Over the years I've been asked to create things
