- I want to offer you a position as a community member.
- Plan
	- Get 5 big tents all different types
	- Move to any place of land where you won't raise any alarms and can experiment unbothered
	- Get 4 other people to come to live with you on those 5 tents for as long as they want
	- Raise Coral (my 1 year old son) as a village of 5 adults
	- Invite people with other children
	- Initiate each other
	- Make a time commitment with everyone about how long you will stay in the camp; after the time is over you must empty the camp of all your personal possessions and leave to somewhere else.
	- While you are in the camp everything you receive is shared with the camp as a team
	- It's called a Village Campground Gameworld
	- When the camp is full, with full quorum an additional tent or housing can be added
	- Members can alter their own tents and even replace them to their full
