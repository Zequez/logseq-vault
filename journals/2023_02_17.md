	- > As with any good bourgeois society, Sims society is built around interior
	  decorating. You have to furnish your home, and the game itself offers a dazzling array of
	  dining-room table sets, recliners for every price point, party balloons, and sconces”
	- > “Oversimulated Suburbia,”
	- Despite claiming marquee space in the games’ titles, the simulated humans inhabiting these
	  meticulously-curated environments are best understood not as autonomous agents but as
	  nodes in a network
	- > Sims games establish a world in which objects own people as much as the converse.
	- > Sims games depict humans as dumb responders in intelligent constructed
	  worlds, a portrayal that seems increasingly appropriate in a progressively more networked,
	  digitized, and commodified culture
	- > Sims games are thus properly understood not as
	  simulations of virtual people, but as Wright’s dollhouse metaphor implies, simulations of
	  complex environments. This is reflected in the player’s perspective in Sims games, which is
	  fixed upon structures rather than Sims. The virtual humans leave for work, neighbors drop
	  by, guests float in and out of the screen, but the player, and the experience, is locked upon
	  structures, the nexus of these interactions.
	- > The result of this speculation became the core behavioral model for Sims games, in which objects
	  in Sims’ homes—televisions, stoves, toilets—broadcast messages to Sims about how they
	  can interact. Wright calls this a “proximity pheromone” model, because a particular Sim’s
	  actions are largely determined by the intensity and distance of an object’s broadcasts
	- > Sims and
	  their objects exist in a mutually-dependent complex system, in which any part, when isolated
	  from the whole, loses meaning.
