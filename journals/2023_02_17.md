	- > As with any good bourgeois society, Sims society is built around interior
	  decorating. You have to furnish your home, and the game itself offers a dazzling array of
	  dining-room table sets, recliners for every price point, party balloons, and sconces”
	- > “Oversimulated Suburbia,”
	- Despite claiming marquee space in the games’ titles, the simulated humans inhabiting these
	  meticulously-curated environments are best understood not as autonomous agents but as
	  nodes in a network
	- > Sims games establish a world in which objects own people as much as the converse.
	- > Sims games depict humans as dumb responders in intelligent constructed
	  worlds, a portrayal that seems increasingly appropriate in a progressively more networked,
	  digitized, and commodified culture
