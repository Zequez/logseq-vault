	- Living Outdoors
		- There is in me a deep craving to move outdoors. Waking up and breathing deeply the cold morning air and listening to the chirping birds. Sitting next to the rain, feeling the wet grass with my bare feet.  Being next to the fire, cooking, chopping wood. Caring for the garden. Playing with my cat.
	- Declaring What Is So
		- You unconsciously declare what is so to yourself and others all day.
		- You pay the price of making unconscious, mechanical, reactive declarations your whole life.
		- Making declarations conscious is a skill that can be learned, and it can look like Magic.
		- Declaring is 1 of your 3 powers.
		- Declaring is made with Is Glue.
