- What if we started over the Internet?
	- A case for making StartOver the origin point of the New Internet, as an Experiment.
	- Hey, let's create this cool new thing. Imagine you are starting over civilization. Everyone in your tribe has this fruit of the old civilization, a square box made of light that connects you to everyone else.
	- This box is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. It connects you to everyone, yes, but that means you are also responsible to everyone. That's a lot of responsibility; what if I find a scary character? No way I'm responsible for THOSE OTHERS that are destroying the Earth! I'm not part of THAT culture.
	- I'm sorry to inform you that if you are reading this, in a magical rectangle of wonderment, you are most definitely responsible to the global culture by the mere fact that anyone in that culture can connect directly TO you THROGH that POSSIBILITY PORTAL.
	- Alright, let's get this article back on track.
	- What are the characteristics of this New Internet?
		- There is no concept of ownership; everything is free by default
		- There is 100% transparency; you can know who exactly wrote everything ever written and connect directly to that person
		- There is an objective map of value by keeping track of a THIS IS VALUABLE bookmark tool.
		- It exists INSIDE the OLD INTERNET.
		- There is one page for every
			- Person
			- Group
			- And we
			-
		- Once you find the NEW INTERNET you are in the NEW INTERNET.
			- "Congratulations you have found the NEW INTERNET, welcome to ARCHEARCHY"
			- Here are the tools you will need for your authentic adulthood initiation of a multi-dimensional five-bodies Human Being.
			- The only way to meet others in the New Internet is Exploring.
			- Having found the New Internet is on itself a Big Treasure, but you will find unimaginable Treasures in your journey ahead.
	- This is what I'm taking a stand for.
		- Start a global trend about the New Internet
		- It's an experiment in which we just agree with each other what is the origin point of the New Internet. We just assert "The origin point of the New Internet is Startover.xyz" and that makes it true.
		- We create a new browser for the New Internet that even my grandmother can understand and use.
		- We make the New Internet viral.
		- Every website can add a New Internet button
			- The button will zoom out the current page and show an Interface that was hidden, behind the box
			- This interface has the page of StartOver.xyz as it's Point of Origin; as it's tradition. You can put the Point of Origin on any website, even Google if you want; but why would you want that? You will only connect to things through Google Searches.
		- All your browse history
