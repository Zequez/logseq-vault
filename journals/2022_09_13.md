- What if we started over the Internet?
	- A case for making StartOver the origin point of the New Internet, as an Experiment.
	- Hey, let's create this cool new thing. Imagine you are starting over civilization. Everyone in your tribe has this fruit of the old civilization, a square box made of light that connects you to everyone else.
	- This box is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. It connects you to everyone, yes, but that means you are also responsible to everyone. That's a lot of responsibility; what if I find a scary character? No way I'm responsible for THOSE OTHERS that are destroying the Earth! I'm not part of THAT culture.
	- I'm sorry to inform you that if you are reading this, in a magical rectangle of wonderment, you are most definitely responsible to the global culture by the mere fact that anyone in that culture can connect directly TO you THROGH that POSSIBILITY PORTAL.
