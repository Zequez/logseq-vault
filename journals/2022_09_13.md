- What if we started over the Internet?
	- A case for making StartOver the origin point of the New Internet, as an Experiment.
	- Hey, let's create this cool new thing. Imagine you are starting over civilization. Everyone in your tribe has this fruit of the old civilization, a square box made of light that connects you to everyone else.
	- This box is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. It connects you to everyone, yes, but that means you are also responsible to everyone. That's a lot of responsibility; what if I find a scary character? No way I'm responsible for THOSE OTHERS that are destroying the Earth! I'm not part of THAT culture.
	- I'm sorry to inform you that if you are reading this, in a magical rectangle of wonderment, you are most definitely responsible to the global culture by the mere fact that anyone in that culture can connect directly TO you THROGH that POSSIBILITY PORTAL.
	- Alright, let's get this article back on track.
	- What are the characteristics of this New Internet?
		- There is no concept of ownership; everything is free by default
		- There is 100% transparency; you can know who exactly wrote everything ever written and connect directly to that person
		- There is an objective map of value by keeping track of a THIS IS VALUABLE bookmark tool.
		- It exists INSIDE the OLD INTERNET.
		- There is one page for every
			- Person
			- Group
			- And we
			-
		- Once you find the NEW INTERNET you are in the NEW INTERNET.
			- "Congratulations you have found the NEW INTERNET, welcome to ARCHEARCHY"
			- Here are the tools you will need for your authentic adulthood initiation of a multi-dimensional five-bodies Human Being.
			- The only way to meet others in the New Internet is Exploring.
			- Having found the New Internet is on itself a Big Treasure, but you will find unimaginable Treasures in your journey ahead.
	- This is what I'm taking a stand for.
		- Start a global trend about the New Internet
		- It's an experiment in which we just agree with each other what is the origin point of the New Internet. We just assert "The origin point of the New Internet is Startover.xyz" and that makes it true.
		- We create a new browser for the New Internet that even my grandmother can understand and use.
		- We make the New Internet viral.
		- Every website can add a New Internet button
			- The button will zoom out the current page and show an Interface that was hidden, behind the box
			- This interface has the page of StartOver.xyz as it's Point of Origin; as it's tradition. You can put the Point of Origin on any website, even Google if you want; but why would you want that? You will only connect to things through Google Searches.
		- All your browse history is seen as a tree that maps to that Point of Origin.
		- newinternet.quest domain name is available; maybe?
		- newinternet.earth?
		- I tend to get hang up in domain names; but where we're going we won't need domain names. We just need one, the Point of Origin of The New Origin; the point of origin is just an arbitrary domain name in The Old Internet.
		- The Point of Origin can even be your site if you want.
		- A graph map is generated from all your New Internet exploration.
		- Advocating for freeing every tool used; but never discriminating against a tool for the mere reason of it not being free
			- Even if the intention of the tool-maker is PROFIT; we are inviting everyone to Archearchy, and were we are going we won't need money, so why would you focus on that?
			- High Technology is obfuscated by our very nature of being ignorant of it's complexity. For most people every software is closed source, because reading code, or even accessing the code, or even being aware that there is a code, is not a given for everyone; for some people it's indistinguishable from magic, so we should treat it as such. There are mages that Understand The Internet; Initiates in the Art of Coding from the Old Civilization.
				- I happen to have been initiated into coding the Internet. And most people can understand it enough to co-create it freely within it with the right coaching.
					- New Internet Coaching is starting to sound like a job title I'm happy with.
						- I'm exploding with joy.
	- So many responsibilities! AHHHH! Something in me is panicking; anyone could hold an EHP for this FEAR?

	  background-color:: #793e3e
		- I want an EHP so bad.
		- There is this pride about knowing how to registering and using a domain name. It's such a basic skill and I'm holding on to it as if a big treasure.
		- Full disclosure, I've consumed cannabis tonight now. WHY AM I FEELING SO AWFUL **ABOUT** THAT!? I'm doing so much EFFORT to RESIST something.
		- I'm feeling so cold. The window is open, it's 8ÂºC and it's 00:22 after midnight. So this might be ACTUAL cold. But the weird thing is that I wasn't feeling cold just moments ago, and the temperature for sure didn't change much; so what's the deal with that? I'm shivering.
	- Alright, back on track on this article. I didn't know I was writing an article when I started writing today. Now I'm certain. I'm taking a stand to clean and polish this rough, painful and emotional article and share it with as many people as possible.
