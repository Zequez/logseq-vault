					- Where attention flows is where energy goes; that's creating our experience
		- Is the driving force behind our thoughts, our actions and our emotions. All 3 of these are coming from our Care.
			- Physical heart is the primary motor in our body; the metaphysical corresponding is the heart center; the primary pump of the torus field of the quantum field.
