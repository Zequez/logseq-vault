- # Unblock Third Eye
	- Intellect is overpowering Intuition. The Intellectual Body is overpowering the Emotional / Energetic / Physical Body. The Masculine Part of Our Brain is overpowering the Feminine Part of Our Brain.
	- Third eye is activated through the equilibrium of these 2 hemispheres. Either way we are unbalanced (either one overpowering the other), and won't be able to create the equilibrium that takes the Third Eye to open.
	- In the intellect driven world of [[Patriarchy]] the [[Masculine]] hemisphere is overpowering the [[Femenine]] one. Our Intellect is overpowering our Intuition.
	- To balance this situation we don't need to get rid of our Intellectual abilities; but rather start to notice when it's being used to or regulate
