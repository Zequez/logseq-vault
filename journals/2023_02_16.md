- Celebrate while you code
	- I had just finished writing a functioning test system for a piece of code, and it was working, the code was being tested, success at last! But there was a bitter taste in my body as I continued the process, time was short and the clock is ticking, I need to keep moving!
		- Then I realized that the bitter taste was my joy being repressed by my scarcity mindset.
	- So what I did next was to break into a dance, the music was on and my body was flowing and joy ran through me.
	- Then I was super relaxed and could continue to write and test my code with a newfound source of joy.
