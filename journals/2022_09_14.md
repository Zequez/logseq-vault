- # ACTION
	- Alright, let's take action. I want that article published and a new personal site by tomorrow morning; then share the article with the PM community; specifically with the Possibility Creation Village team; and then on the EHP team quote a specific paragraph of the article and ask for an EHP before leaving for my niece birthday tomorrow.
	- DONE I'm creating the personal site with Carrd.co for Archearchy

	- I'm a New Internet Coach from Archearchy. Experimenter. Apprentice 
	  Possibilitator and Mage.
	- I'm work for Team Gaia.
	- I'm a New Refugee from patriarchal culture. I started my authentic 
	  adulthood initiatory path after discovering Startover from researching 
	  ecovillaging at GEN, and I've been mostly exploring, reading and doing 
	  experiments by myself for a few months.

	  Money Club, distilling my Bright Principles, Stellating my feelings, 
	  learning interspecies communication, space-holding, space-navigating, 
	  ecovillaging and who knows what other Next-Culture skills or workshops 
	  that I don't know about or don't even exist yet.
	- I'm co-creating the New Internet and making it accessible to everyone.
