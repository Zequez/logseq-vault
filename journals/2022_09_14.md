	- What if I make it easy to setup auto-publishing of your LogSeq vault
	- I'm imagining setting up auto-publishing for LogSeq vault and making a guide for anyone to follow; then sharing with the PM community and inviting people to experiment with LogSeq vaults. Do I want to commit to this? Do I want to take a stand? What is the next question to ask?
		- Why am I feeling ambivalent about this?
			- There is an emotional resistance to do it. An **I-DON'T-KNOW** energy. And it seems that yes, I don't know how I'm going to do the thing. I can still commit to do it even before I don't know how to.
				- I feel afraid, it's scary to commit to do something I don't know how to do. I know I want it to happen, I know it is possible for it to happen. I'm stuck in the idea that I'm the one that has to do it. It's a responsibility, I'm afraid.
			- There is something more. There is the sharing part, that has a fear energy, a vulnerability-aversion-energy, _I'm afraid to share an early draft, it has to be perfect or they might think I'm an idiot._
				- There is some unwrapping to do here. My center is not with me. Am I receiving emotional feedback when I give away my center? Or is there an aversion to the emotion that makes me give my center away? What comes first, giving my center away or having an emotional reaction? It seems to me that giving my center away makes the emotional reaction unconscious, and thus I don't have to feel it. But then, I find the reaction in the other, and I tell myself that the other is causing me an emotional reaction; when in reality, I'm shifting the responsibility for the emotional reaction by giving my center away to another person while I could be just being there with the emotions.
					- There is an annoyance now, to having written a long-winded message and forgetting to be present or what my original purpose was. A **FUCK-I'M-ANGRY-I'M-LOST** energy, and also a **I-LOST-MY-PATHðŸ˜­** victim-energy. It's a depressing sensation.
						- So I am asserting the realization that I **became lost**. What does becoming lost even means.

	- Hey so I just felt excitement about doing something.
		- I see 4 tabs that represent my New Internet Profile
			- It's separate addresses that are linked together; usually by a central address that links them all
				- https://zequez.carrd.co/ - Personal Site that expresses my individuality aesthetically and links to other sites
				- https://zequez.substack.com - Publishing Articles & Newsletter Subscription
				- https://ko-fi.com/zequez - Personal Funding Origin that allows anyone to flow me power
					- There are other options such as:
						- Using Substack directly, as it has funding embedded into itself already.
							- Paying subscribers might get benefits, such as being on a group-chat with me and other subscribers, and participate in the design of future workshops. Ok, now this is looking more enticing! Being a paid subscriber expresses commitment.
							- New Internet Lab where we explore what are the possibilities of using the Internet to viralize the adoption of Archearchy culture.
								- What if the New Internet have a viral design integrated into it?

				- https://t.me/zequez - Direct link to messaging me directly

		- How can I motivate people into flowing power into me and supporting me?
			- Use information about contributions to prioritises access to workshops of limited capacity of participants. So highest contributors will be on he first cohort and so on. All workshops are free by default, but I give priority to my stakeholders, the people that are most committed to my evolution. Subscribing to me shows commitment.
				- There is no rigid expectation about this workshop commitment, I can abide by flexible rules, it's an experiment on
			-

			- I can say that the Point of Origin of my Profile is https://zequez.carrd.co/
