- # ACTION
	- Alright, let's take action. I want that article published and a new personal site by tomorrow morning; then share the article with the PM community; specifically with the Possibility Creation Village team; and then on the EHP team quote a specific paragraph of the article and ask for an EHP before leaving for my niece birthday tomorrow.
	- DONE I'm creating the personal site with Carrd.co for Archearchy

	- DONE I'm taking an updated picture to put on the page. No filters, no posing, no trying-to-hide-the-messy-house-you-live-in, just an authentic up-to-date full-face selfie! You can update the picture later! Maybe AFTER the EHP?
