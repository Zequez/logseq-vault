- # ACTION
	- Alright, let's take action. I want that article published and a new personal site by tomorrow morning; then share the article with the PM community; specifically with the Possibility Creation Village team; and then on the EHP team quote a specific paragraph of the article and ask for an EHP before leaving for my niece birthday tomorrow.
	- DONE I'm creating the personal site with Carrd.co for Archearchy

	- LATER I'm publishing my entire LogSeq vault so I can share the article I wrote directly from it
		- DNS check in progress! Should be live at http://oldsite.zequez.space/logseq-vault/ at some point in theory
