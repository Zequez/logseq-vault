	- > Can you help me clarify what my project is about in a way that I can explain it to other people?
		- Sure! To help you explain your project to others, it's important to first clarify the main idea or purpose of the project. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you do that:
		- 1. What is the problem that my project is trying to solve?
		- 2. What is the main goal or objective of my project?
		- 3. Who is my target audience or user group, and how will they benefit from my project?
		- 4. What makes my project unique or different from other similar projects or solutions?
		- 5. What are the key features or functionalities of my project?
		  
		  Once you've answered these questions, you can use the information to create a brief and clear explanation of your project. Here's an example of how you might explain a project in a simple and concise way:
		  
		  "Our project is a mobile app that helps people manage their daily tasks more efficiently. We noticed that many people struggle with keeping track of their to-do lists and often feel overwhelmed by the number of tasks they have to complete. Our app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to create and organize their tasks, set reminders, and prioritize their workload. Our unique approach uses artificial intelligence algorithms to learn the user's preferences and suggest ways to optimize their daily routine. We believe our app will help people be more productive and reduce stress levels, and we're excited to bring it to market soon."
		  
		  Remember to practice your pitch and adjust it based on your audience and their level of knowledge about your project. Good luck!
	- The basics of getting a website online are still too complicated, hidden
	   behind monetization of hosting services. As I'm writing this, the 
	  hosting of static websites is essentially a public utility of the 
	  Internet, you can get started with having complex apps online without 
	  any cost essentially. Services like Vercel, Netlify, Pinata, Cloudflare,
	   and many others give you free space to host your sandbox website, and 
	  you can use any domain name you want for it. I want to bring the power 
	  of using the web as a free sandbox to everyone.
	- I want people without any knowledge of coding to be able to create web 
	  apps in an instant by copy-pasting AI-generated code. I want a culture 
	  where we build our peer-to-peer apps like playing together with Lego 
	  bricks.

	- Prototype
		- Go to yourspace.archy.site and see if it's available.
			- If it's available click to create a key for the space.
				- Save the key, whoever has the key can edit the space.
			- After this you can also use the same key to access
				- sub.yourspace.archy.site
				- Or yourspace.archy.site/sub-page
		- The key is stored on the browser, and when on a page, to show the key-UI you tap shift 3 times.
			- On the key UI
			- Keys are stored on localstorage.
				- This means subdomains will need to re-insert the key again...
			- You can delete the key from storage
			- Insert a key for the site
			- Close the key UI by clicking away, cross icon, or ESC key
		- Page is blank with a sign indicating that the space is available if it's not claimed yet
		- Edit mode is opened by tapping shift 3 times
			- On edit mode the screen is divided in 2, one is an iframe with the page content, and the other is the entire HTML code, for the sake of simplicity 1 page = 1 HTML code, and you can put CSS and JavaScript there any way you want. When the code changes the iframe updates.
			- All changes are local. If you want to publish the changes you need to insert a key, if the space is available you can create a key or insert your existing key so that the space responds to that key.
		- You are then invited to copy-paste code from ChatGPT to generate the website
		- In the future, AI-piloted coding is then added into the system, and you can prompt things like Github Co-pilot right from there
