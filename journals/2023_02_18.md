	- The basics of getting a website online are still too complicated, hidden
	   behind monetization of hosting services. As I'm writing this, the 
	  hosting of static websites is essentially a public utility of the 
	  Internet, you can get started with having complex apps online without 
	  any cost essentially. Services like Vercel, Netlify, Pinata, Cloudflare,
	   and many others give you free space to host your sandbox website, and 
	  you can use any domain name you want for it. I want to bring the power 
	  of using the web as a free sandbox to everyone.
	- I want people without any knowledge of coding to be able to create web 
	  apps in an instant by copy-pasting AI-generated code. I want a culture 
	  where we build our peer-to-peer apps like playing together with Lego 
	  bricks.
