	- The basics of getting a website online are still too complicated, hidden
	   behind monetization of hosting services. As I'm writing this, the 
	  hosting of static websites is essentially a public utility of the 
	  Internet, you can get started with having complex apps online without 
	  any cost essentially. Services like Vercel, Netlify, Pinata, Cloudflare,
	   and many others give you free space to host your sandbox website, and 
	  you can use any domain name you want for it. I want to bring the power 
	  of using the web as a free sandbox to everyone.
	- I want people without any knowledge of coding to be able to create web 
	  apps in an instant by copy-pasting AI-generated code. I want a culture 
	  where we build our peer-to-peer apps like playing together with Lego 
	  bricks.

	- Prototype
		- Go to yourspace.archy.site and see if it's available.
			- If it's available click to create a key for the space.
				- Save the key, whoever has the key can edit the space.
			- After this you can also use the same key to access
				- sub.yourspace.archy.site
				- Or yourspace.archy.site/sub-page
		- The key is stored on the browser, and when on a page, to show the key-UI you tap shift 3 times.
			- On the key UI
			- Keys are stored on localstorage.
				- This means subdomains will need to re-insert the key again...
			- You can delete the key from storage
			- Insert a key for the site
			- Close the key UI by clicking away, cross icon, or ESC key
		- Page is blank with a sign indicating that the space is available if it's not claimed yet
		- Edit mode is opened by tapping shift 3 times
			- On edit mode the screen is divided in 2, one is an iframe with the page content, and the other is the entire HTML code, for the sake of simplicity 1 page = 1 HTML code, and you can put CSS and JavaScript there any way you want. When the code changes the iframe updates.
			- All changes are local. If you want to publish the changes you need to insert a key, if the space is available you can create a key or insert your existing key so that the space responds to that key.
		- You are then invited to copy-paste code from ChatGPT to generate the website
		- In the future, AI-piloted coding is then added into the system, and
