	- I've been setting up a new project to explore what I can build for the [[Law of Time]] movement. I registered the domain tzolkin.me and I'll be building some stuff. [[Proyecto: Sincronario]]
		- I set up a Supabase app which was surprisingly easy, started with a Todo template and it's already working even with Google sign up.

			- Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative, which I'll be using while I decentralized alternatives such as [[Holochain]] become easier to use, or at least until I learn how to use them to quickly develop apps. Right now I'm prototyping so I don't mind a central server, after all, as of right now we always need at least a central server when using web apps, even if using P2P (for peer-discoverability). One caveat is that Supabase uses Postgres, and I would rather use a graphDB, but no matter, I can still make it work.
			- The starter I picked is for React and uses [Craco (Create-react-app)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco). I'll also change this to something else, I prefer Astro for framework-agnosticism.
