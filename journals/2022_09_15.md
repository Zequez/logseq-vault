	- I've seen people use this pattern on LogSeq, of typing the hour of the day and writing.
	- I would like to see the following UI used:
		- Instead of scrolling from the top to the bottom the page is loaded with the scrollbar on the bottom. When you write the page just extends, and you are still at the bottom. The old entries are all up. We write from top to bottom, why do we insist on inverting the direction when it comes to presenting chronological content? By using this we can show a single timeline and we can show the dates and time directly from the Git information.
		- We use only Tags for tracking content. Links do not need the names of the linked blocks, the address is an abstract information. Adding a title to a block it can be referenced.
		  id:: 6322a1f4-23c6-428f-ad29-6b5f4af9f321
		- This is a reference to the mentioned block ((6322a1f4-23c6-428f-ad29-6b5f4af9f321))
			- Can we make the referencing more organic?
			- Convert a block to a page by a touch; the only reason to convert a block to a page is to reference it later with a shortcut. Instead of writing the block number for the link, we can write the name of the page.
			- What is lacking in this system, is a button that I can click and a block is extracted into a page, but replaced with an embedded reference.
				- Looks like this was discussed https://discuss.logseq.com/t/convert-block-to-a-page/649
	- I have stumbled upon a philosophical work of note-taking

		- “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”

			- > The goal is not to take notes—the goal is to think effectively. Better 
			  questions are “what practices can help me reliably develop insights over
			   time?”, “how can I shepherd my attention effectively?”
			- > In terms of technology, what matters is not “computer-support note-taking” but “computer supported thinking.”

			- > Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to 
			  make. To  make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many 
			  independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly 
			  converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a
			   few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.

			- > For example, [people struggle to absorb new material when their working memory is already overloaded](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/).
			   More concretely: if you’ve just been introduced to a zoo of new terms, 
			  you probably won’t absorb much from a sentence which uses many of those 
			  terms at once. So maybe part of “what’s necessary to understand” 
			  something is that most of its prerequisites must be not just familiar 
			  but fluent, encoded in long-term memory.
