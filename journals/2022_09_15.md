	- I've seen people use this pattern on LogSeq, of typing the hour of the day and writing.
	- I would like to see the following UI used:
		- Instead of scrolling from the top to the bottom the page is loaded with the scrollbar on the bottom. When you write the page just extends, and you are still at the bottom. The old entries are all up. We write from top to bottom, why do we insist on inverting the direction when it comes to presenting chronological content? By using this we can show a single timeline and we can show the dates and time directly from the Git information.
		- We don't allow creation of pages
