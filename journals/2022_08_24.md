	- Dear village, I want to serve this community with the skills that I've used for too long to serve the patriarchy. I can build customized web apps from the ground up and digitally automate work, and I want to put this in service of Gaia.
	- My intellectual wheels have been spinning in place getting nowhere on the fantasy that if I can just focus and build something incredible to _prove my worth_ people would feel so grateful that they would want to patreon me to keep building amazing stuff. I haven't lead me anywhere except a dozen half-started projects that barely anyone knows about. And every day I'm feeling pangs of anxiety build up pressure as my funds run out because I don't want to go back to sell my time to yet another meaningless tech company.
	- I need help with:
		- Finding a channel where my contribution is valued
		- Moving to an ecovillage with my family (partner, 10-moons-old son and I) and learning ecovillaging hands-on
		- Bring a ETB training to wherever I am as soon as possible
