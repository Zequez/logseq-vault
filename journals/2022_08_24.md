	- Dear village, I want to serve this community with the skills that I've used for too long to serve the patriarchy. I can build customized web apps and digitally automate work, and I want to put this in service of Gaia. My intellectual wheels have been spinning in place getting nowhere trying to _figure out_ what to focus on and build that people would feel so grateful that they would want to give me money.
