	- I cannot will myself to be committed
	- In [[Archiarchy]] vocation is being-based
		- "It's not skilled-based; they are not holding a context, they are holding a skill"
		- "I commit to become the thing that will be committed to the trainer path"
			- Commit to being committed
	- Old map
		- Commitments exist somewhere else; it does not exist here (to my job, my partner, my project, etc)
		- "I said I would, I'm supposed to, I should, I have to"
		- I'm a slave to my commitments
	- New Map
		- Commitment emerges from the creation of inner structure
			- Broadening of inner structure; broader sphere of responsibility
				- Commitments exist within this
		- When I commit I lose something
			- I choose this; therefore I don't want this or that
			- Lose invisibility; you commit you become visible
		- My commitments are forces of energy of information; I'm energized by the commitment
