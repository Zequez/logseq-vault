- Thoughtware does not only involve thoughts.
- Thoughtware
   shapes the way life-energies flow through your Energetic Body. In this 
  way, thoughtware shapes who you are, what is possible for you, what you 
  are aware of, what you can take authority for, etc.
- In this way, your thoughtware shapes the way you are regarded by the Universe.
- Your thoughtware is a central determinant of what the Earth Coincidence 
  Control Office ([[E.C.C.O.]]) can do with you, what alchemical ingredient 
  you can be for them in causing an evolution of consciousness process for
   you, for another person, for a local or global gameworld, or for the 
  Earth's morphogenetic field.
