- A Gong Journey is a [[Gameworld]] that consists of a [[Spaceholder]] that occupies a ultrasafe Archiarchal Workspace
- I experiment with. The gameworld consists of a spaceholder who occupies a ultrasafe archiarchal workspace.
  In this ultrasafe workspace initiated adults go in resonance with a gong that is very softly touched by the spaceholder.
- The purpose of the gameworld is to resonate and with that reach frequencies that have unaccessable because of box mechanisms.
