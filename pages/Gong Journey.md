- A Gong Journey is a [[Gameworld]] that consists of a [[Spaceholder]] that occupies a ultrasafe [[Archiarchal Workspace]].
- In this workspace [[Initiated Adults]] go into [[Resonance]] with a gong that is very softly touched by the spaceholder.
- The purpose of the Gameworld is to resonate and with that reach frequencies that are unaccessible due to [[Box]] mechanisms.
