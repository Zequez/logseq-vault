- Ideas are instant. Actually materializing the idea requires [[Focused Attention]] for extended periods of time. What this means is that you need to focus on the right things at the right time; and the shit will be done like magic.

			- I experienced exasperation (anger? impatience?) as I realized the pen I picked up was not working and angry about whoever left the empty/broken pen with the other pens.
