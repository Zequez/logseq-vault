- Getting shit done is about turning ideas into reality.
- Ideas are instant. Actually materializing the idea requires [[Focused Attention]] for extended periods of time. What this means is that you need to focus on the right things at the right time; and the shit will be done like magic.
- ## Experiment
	- Make a drawing of a turtle and share it online with someone. Take notice to where your attention goes and how the focus feels.
		- ### Results:
			- I experienced anxiety about having to stand up and go to another room to pick up a pen
			- I experienced joy as I saw the [[Beep! Book]] along with the pen, and realized that I actually would like to draw the turtle on the Beep! Book rather than on the other notebook that I have.
			- I experienced exasperation (anger? ) as I realized the pen I picked up was not working and angry about whoever left the empty/broken pen with the other pens.
			- I laughed (joy) when I realized that after picking up another working-pen, I had put back the empty pen with the other pens. The joke was that I might have been angry at myself; kinda barking at my own tail. [[What can you do with an empty plastic pen?]]
			- I experienced anxiety while I started drawing the turtle and the details of what was actually needed to be created started to become clear. I did not know how the turtle was going to look before I finished. It was like I was discovering what I was drawing, as I was drawing it.
				- The sequence was the rough shape of the body. Then the fins (ah, yes, a marine turtle, the experiment didn't specify, but I realized I had chosen to draw a marine turtle after I drew the fins). Then the shell divisions. The head. And then shading to add a gamut of color.
			- Then I shared the experiment with my partner through Telegram with the words "Un experimento". I went very safe with my choice in partner. Could have been used to start an [[Extraordinary Conversation]] with many people. It still can; I could keep sharing it with the exact words and see if someone asks about it and share what learned.
			- This is what I learned:
				- Between the idea and the idea becoming a reality, there is an ocean of emotional energy. There is no guarantee that the voyage will be calm and peaceful. But as long as I know where I'm going and my compass is calibrated
