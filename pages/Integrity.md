- Without integrity nothing works
	- If something doesn't work: start looking, where do I behave out of integrity?
- Taking [[Radical Responsibility]] for your words.
- When I say I do this and I don't do it, then I'm behaving out of integrity
- When I say I don't do this and I do this, then I'm behaving out of integrity
- What is the source of my behaviour?
	- What is it that I didn't look at when I gave my word that I would do something?
		- It's a revelation.
- It's about being curious about what is the source of my action, or the source of my inactions.
- Understatements and exaggerations are both out of integrity
- 6 different ways I give my word
	- I do what I say
	- I do what I know
		- Example: I have an appointment with you and I know I'll be late, I give a notice.
		- Example: I know a culture has certain rules, and if I act differently, I'm acting out of integrity
			- Acting differently without taking a stand for acting differently
	- My word is what others expect them; and it's also to say what you expect of others
		- Notice expectations and either fulfill them or make them know beforehand that the expectation won't be fulfilled
		- Active expectation management
	- What I say is so
		- Be honest with the limits of your knowledge; where you got it and how deep you went into researching
	- I do what I stand for
		- Be that person
		- Integrity is necessary to take a stand for the other bright principles
	- I follow the rules and standards of every organization or government that I'm participant on; unless you are in integrity if you say I don't
- Integrity is a mountain without top; you better learn to love to climb.
- Keeping my word and honoring my word
	- I give my word and keep my word, and if I cannot keep my word the moment I discover this, I tell the other person this is so.
	- Energy is freed up
- Commitment is action; no action no commitment.
	- No-action is also an action.
- What is necessary to love the climb?
	- Wanting a life that's bigger than yourself
		- Beyond the "I" mind we're so well trained to live in
	- Am I happy with the way I show up for life?
	- Say yes to life, say yes to opportunities
