- It's a club for building the Archiarchy World Wide Web (the AWWW) together.
	- How does AWWW feels for you?
		- Like something beautiful that's also very fragile and could break and die at any moment. Like a very small kitten
		- Like strong desire to posses something
- Mix with Language Learning Club
	- Language of club meeting is constantly changing
- Mix with Money Club

		- Hello village! I'm at the intersection of Archiarchy and Web Development and I'm taking a stand for Web Weaving Club to exist. At Web Weaving Club we both build the web (as in the Internet web), and we also weave each other by using the things we build to interconnect and empower ourselves.
		- You can [visit the form here and sign up](https://forms.gle/z1nSULc4YS4rfCkW6). After signing up you may visit the current experimental [Web Weaving Club dashboard](https://gsheets-based-website.zequez.space/side-by-side) where you will see all other members. During Web Weaving Club meetings you can propose to add information-protocol prompts for all members to share and then display at the club dashboard.
		- The club dashboard is in itself a web experiment; it uses an editable Google-form, a Google-spreadsheet and then with the data from the responses it generates a website to explore the information visually. If you are interested in such dashboard for your own club, team, village, group, family or whatever, I can set you up with one for you to experiment as a service in the spirit of the gift.
			- If you are feeling grateful and are joining Web Weaving Club you can express your gratitude by writing down a service-offer with the Gratitude Virtual Currency Accounting information-protocol (it's another web experiment), to invite anyone to ask you privately for it.
		- I'm holding space for a Web Weaving Club circle in the next 3 hours at [this Zoom room](Not really yet) that anyone can join and explore with me the possibilities.
	- DONE Share invitation with at least 3 people from the PM context
		- DONE Michael Lebensfreude
			- Expressed concerns about how public the information is
		- DONE Sky Blu
		- DONE Nicole Bradford

			- > I am turned on that this can be a place to 'meet' each other, other evolutionaries, to update info and touch in.
			- Expressed confusion about how she didn't know where the thank you part went.
		- DONE Devin Gleeson
		- DONE Gabriela
			- Sent me a long audio with a lot of feedback, clarity and proposals <3
			- Make more clear value in your writing. Bring not reason, but use anger to bring why is important, why do you care. She says it's not clear for her what is the value to me.
			- Invitation not working.
			- Invite me to write what is Web Weaving Club
				- What is it
				- Why do I care about it, why I'm taking a stand
				- For what, what is the purpose; bring a clear purpose behind; if you don't express the purpose clearly what goes on is shadow world.
					- Does not have to be grandiose, could be simple like "have people together"
				-
