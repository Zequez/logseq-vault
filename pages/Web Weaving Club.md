		- Hello village! I'm at the intersection of Archiarchy and Web Development and I'm taking a stand for Web Weaving Club to exist. At Web Weaving Club we both build the web (as in the Internet web), and we also weave each other by using the things we build to interconnect and empower ourselves.
		- You can [visit the form here and sign up](https://forms.gle/z1nSULc4YS4rfCkW6). After signing up you may visit the current experimental [Web Weaving Club dashboard](https://gsheets-based-website.zequez.space/side-by-side) where you will see all other members. During Web Weaving Club meetings you can propose to add information-protocol prompts for all members to share and then display at the club dashboard.
		- The club dashboard is in itself a web experiment; it uses an editable Google-form, a Google-spreadsheet and then with the data from the responses it generates a website to explore the information visually. If you are interested in such dashboard for your own club, team, village, group, family or whatever, I can set you up with one for you to experiment as a service in the spirit of the gift.
			- If you are feeling grateful and are joining Web Weaving Club you can express your gratitude by writing down a service-offer with the Gratitude Virtual Currency Accounting information-protocol (it's another web experiment), to invite anyone to ask you privately for it.
		- I'm holding space for a Web Weaving Club circle in the next 3 hours at [this Zoom room](Not really yet) that anyone can join and explore with me the possibilities.
