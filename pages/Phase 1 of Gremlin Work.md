- Whatever part of your Gremlin you don't own, owns you.
	- Whereas previously [[Gremlin]] ran wild, knocked you unconscious, and did whatever it wanted with your life, now your job is to make Gremlin your ally instead of your owner.
- The purpose is about changing the relationship of your Gremlin that is protecting your [[Box]], to initiate it into serving your [[Archetypal Lineage]], your [[Adult Ego State]].
- The work is about becoming aware of the food and schedule you are unconsciously feeding your gremlin with, and training him into a disciplined feeding plan and schedule.

- ## Strategy
	- Start to notice and make your own list of [[Food Gremlin Loves To Eat]]. Make it at least 50 items..
	- Pick 10 items from the list
		- Write them in paper and put them on a visible place to see
	- Pick a fixed day of the week
		- Fast for 6 days and allow the Gremlin to eat from the list on the 7th day
	- Don't be discouraged if Gremlin knocks you unconscious and wake up on the other side of a binge quarrel. Do not feel guilty. Do not beat yourself up. Do not punish your Gremlin. Remake the commitment and keep your promise to maximum feeding on the specified day, only.
	- Gremlin can put a constant stream of voices in your head "This is stupid! I hate this! Mmm, a little bit of chocolate would be ok. What a bitch! I can't do this anymore! I'm a failure! I'm not good enough! I will never make it! Whose idea was this anyway? Not mine. Fucking Clinton Callahan!" And so on. These are only voices. You can use your [[Voice Blaster]].
	- It might take months before you can go an entire week without Gremlin snacking in-between.
