- ## Whatever part of your Gremlin you don't own, owns you
- Whereas previously Gremlin ran wild, knocked you unconscious, and did whatever it wanted with your life, now your job is to make Gremlin your ally instead of your owner.
- Is about becoming aware of the food and schedule you are unconsciously feeding your gremlin with, and training him into a disciplined feeding plan and schedule.

- ## Strategy
	- Start to notice and make your own list of [[Food Gremlin Loves To Eat]]
	- Pick 10 items from the list
		- Write them in paper and put them on a visible place to see
	- Pick a fixed day of the week
		- Fast for 6 days and allow the Gremlin to eat from the list on the 7th day
	- Don't be discouraged if Gremlin knocks you unconscious and wake up on the other side of a binge quarrel. Do not feel guilty. Do not beat yourself up. Do not punish your Gremlin. Remake the commitment and keep your promise to maximum feeding on the specified day, only.
