- This is the [[Digital Knowledge Garden]] of [[Ezequiel Adrian Schwartzman]], also known as the [[Zequez]] [[Identity]].
- The notes I'm writing on each day are logged on the [:a {:href "#/all-journals"} "journals"] page. My writing strategy changed over time and there are many old notes that I haven't fully integrated into the garden yet.
- I'm an [[Experimenter]], a [[Possibilitator]] in training. I'm currently researching [[Possibility Management]] and [[Archearchy]].
- My edge is the web, and I'm exploring the [[Possibilities]] of harnessing the powers of the Internet and the web to do collaborative research and build [[Matrix]]. This website is how the research looks like.
- I have [[Offerings]]
