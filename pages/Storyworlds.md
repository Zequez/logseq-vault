- Stories are the tool humans use to cooperate flexibly at large scale.
- Examples of storyworlds:
	- Religion stories
	- Human rights stories
	- States and nations
	- Money is the most successful story
- Humans live in a dual reality. Over objective reality we created a layer of fictional reality.

- Irresponsible stories
	- Telling a victim story about what happened comes from the [[Parent Ego State]] or [[Child Ego State]].
- Responsible stories
	- Take exact same circumstances, same incident, same people involved, same actions, and we can create a responsible story about being involved in these circumstances.
	- Responsible stories place us "at cause" of the circumstances.
		- Why would I create this?
		- How is this serving me?
	- Creating Responsible Stories is a skill
	- Even if our purpose for landing on a situation were unconscious, they are still a purpose, and we created the situation.
