- Stories are the tool humans use to cooperate flexibly at large scale.
- Examples of storyworlds:
	- Religion stories
	- Human rights stories
	- States and nations
	- Money is the most successful story
- Humans live in a dual reality. Over objective reality we created a layer of fictional reality.
- When humans believe in a story they enter into a state of [[Entrancement]] with the story.
	- Stories a kind of [[Magic]].
- Storyworlds are fractals
- The world is going through a story transition, currently we are at the [[Time Between Stories]]
- Storytelling is a skill, and it is possible to [[Tell Better Stories]]

- Irresponsible stories
	- Telling a victim story about what happened comes from the [[Parent Ego State]] or [[Child Ego State]].
- Responsible stories
	- Take exact same circumstances, same incident, same people involved, same actions, and we can create a responsible story about being involved in these circumstances.
	- Responsible stories place us "at cause" of the circumstances.
		- Why would I create this?
		- How is this serving me?
	- Creating Responsible Stories is a skill
	- Even if our purpose for landing on a situation were unconscious, they are still a purpose, and we created the situation.
		- Unconscious purposes; an outstanding victim story can give you many benefits.
	- You can take responsibility for all your stories about your parents by remembering that you picked your parents for your personal evolution.
		- Same with partners, and children.
-
- From irresponsible to responsible examples:
	- I do not have time for his -> I will not make time for this
	- I can't do this -> Until now I have always chosen not to do this
- Stories are stories. There is no such thing as a true story. Neither irresponsible nor responsible stories are true.
- Taking a step beyond stories requires tremendous courage.
	- Can you admit that no matter how grim or how funny your piece of theater is, it is still theater?
- Taking actions from the realization that one is the story maker is part of [[Radical Responsibility]].
- [[Gremlin]] is usually controlling the movie projector. The Gremlin stories serve [[Shadow Principles]] of our Hidden Purpose.
	- Taking responsibility for being the story maker assumes our willingness to find ourselves personally responsible for hurting other people and feeling glad about it.
- ## Victim Stories Are Not Bad
	- They just produce ordinary predicable results: [[Low Drama]] and [[Ordinary Human Relationships]].
- ## Responsible Stories Are Not Good
	- They just produce [[High Drama]] and [[Extraordinary Human Relationships]].
-
- Replacing victim with responsible stories is a process that happens gradually through the painful experience of becoming aware of how ridiculous our victim stories are.
	- Impersonal remorse.
- We slip into [[Archetypal Relationship]] reflexively through a shift of context:
	- I am the story maker
	- I make up no story accidentally
	- Every story is meaningless
	- Every story has a purpose
		- Either I am not aware of the purpose of my story in which case it serves an [[Unconscious Purpose]]
		- Or I am aware of the purpose of my story and I enter [[Extraordinary Human Relationships]].
- The [[Context]] of Archetypal Relationship has such clarity about story making that stories become alike waves in the ocean, and you can surf them or let them crash purposelessly. The wave does not automatically drag you along.
- Freedom from meaningfulness of stories does not imply freedom from stories. There will always be stories. You may as well use stories that let you walk through your day with some bounce in your step.
	- You could make up an entirely new Responsible Story right now that releases you from being a victim of all of your previous victim stories.
		- “I am so grateful for everything that has happened to me so far, no matter how painful it was at the time, because what happened has given me the wisdom to make better choices now.”
- [[Energetic Surgery To Rewire Stories]]
- A [[Minimized Now]] it's too small to hold stories. If you are in a story you are in time and not in now.
	- You can shift into a new space by minimizing your now until it's small enough to slide sideways through the gaps between moments.
