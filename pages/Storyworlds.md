- Stories are the tool humans use to cooperate flexibly at large scale.
- Examples of storyworlds:
	- Religion stories
	- Human rights stories
	- States and nations
	- Money is the most successful story
- Humans live in a dual reality. Over objective reality we created a layer of fictional reality.

- Irresponsible stories
	- Telling a victim story about what happened comes from the [[Parent Ego State]] or [[Child Ego State]].
- Responsible stories
	- Take exact same circumstances, same incident, same people involved, same actions, and we can create a responsible story about being involved in these circumstances.
	- Responsible stories place us "at cause" of the circumstances.
		- Why would I create this?
		- How is this serving me?
	- Creating Responsible Stories is a skill
	- Even if our purpose for landing on a situation were unconscious, they are still a purpose, and we created the situation.
		- Unconscious purposes; an outstanding victim story can give you many benefits.
	- You can take responsibility for all your stories about your parents by remembering that you picked your parents for your personal evolution.
		- Same with partners, and children.

- From irresponsible to responsible examples:
	- I do not have time for his -> I will not make time for this
	- I can't do this -> Until now I have always chosen not to do this
- Stories are stories. There is no such thing as a true story. Neither irresponsible nor responsible stories are true.
- Taking a step beyond stories requires tremendous courage.
	- Can you admit that no matter how grim or how funny your piece of theater is, it is still theater?
- Taking actions from the realization that one is the story maker is part of [[Radical Responsibility]].
- [[Gremlin]] is usually controlling the movie projector. The Gremlin stories serve [[Shadow Principles]] of our Hidden Purpose.
	- Taking responsibility for being the story maker assumes our willingness to find ourselves personally responsible for hurting other people and feeling glad about it.
- ## Victim Stories Are Not Bad
	- They just produce ordinary predicable results: [[Low Drama]] and [[Ordinary Human Relationships]].
- ## Responsible Stories Are Not Good
	- They just produce [[High Drama]] and [[Extraordinary Human Relationships]].
-
- Replacing victim with responsible stories is a process that happens gradually through the painful experience of becoming aware of how ridiculous our victim stories are.
	- Impersonal remorse.
- We slip into [[Archetypal Relationship]] reflexively through a shift of context:
	- I am the story maker
	- I make up no story accidentally
	- Every story is meaningless
	- Every story has a purpose
		- Either I am aware of the story
