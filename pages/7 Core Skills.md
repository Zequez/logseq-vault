- ## Experiments
	- ### Remind Yourself That You Are A Possibilitator
		- Figure out 5 different ways to remind yourself to shift identity into being a [[Possibilitator]]. For example:
			- 1. Wear 2 different kinds of shoes. If anyone asks you about it, tell them you are experimenting with various kinds of reminding factors to help you with your Self Observation.
			  2. Set an alarm bell to ring each hour or randomly in the day and each time it rings tell the next person you see that you are a Possibilitator.
			  3. Tap each door frame you go through alternating with the fingers of first your right hand and then your left hand, and with each tap say the word 'Possibilitator.'
			  4. Do 5 'good things' each day, such as picking up a tiny piece of litter, cleaning a window, making tea or a glass of water to someone, giving money to a beggar, say no to your Gremlin, etc. Each time tell someone, "Possibilitators do things like this..."
