- ## Preparation
	- This is a phase to invite new beginnings. Welcome new challenges set yourself new goals or ask for your heart’s desire. During a New Moon Ritual, it is usual to set intentions and focus on how you will manifest these intentions during the coming month. A dark New Moon is a very intimate and powerful ritual, so check what you really want before you make your requests to the universe.
- ## Intentions
	- During a New Moon you want to set positive intentions for yourself so that during the ritual you can commit yourself to manifest these, asking the universe or your spirit guide for help. Try to limit yourself to only a few so that you can really give them proper focus and attention during this Moon cycle. For example:
	- I am ready to …
	    I want to …
	    I ready to meet my new love
	    I want to find my true path in life
	    I will find a new job
