- A double [[Assumption]]. An assumption that your assumption is true.
- If your Expectation is not fulfilled, it turns into a [[Resentment]].
- Expectations Are a Form of Control

	- Giving up the compulsion to have expectations is a rigorous spiritual practice
	- Goal of becoming conscious:
		- Realize what shadow practices you have to release in your life because they do not serve you. Expectations do not serve you.
	- I have been target of expectations; and I have also projected my expectations onto the people in our life
		- This is not an attempt to create a victim/perpetrator drama; projecting expectations is not "bad"; it's a [[Psychic Power]]
	- Are any expectations acceptable? Yes
		- Expecting not to be lied to or betrayed by the people in your inner circle or your trusted friends and family members. This means they have the right to expect exactly the same from you.
			- I can use expectations as a way to energetically keep a mutual agreement.
		- > When expectations are not mutually agreed upon, a person walks on very delicate ground because hidden wounds, unmet personal needs, and who knows what other dark ingredients get projected into the psychic airwaves, bombarding the psychic field of the person you are targeting. Or you get targeted.
		- Psychic Free Radicals that lead to a person to scream one day "No matter what I do, I just can't make you happy. I just can't fulfill your expectatiosn"
	- Questions
		- What are your expectations in life?
		- What are your disappointments?
		- What do you feel is expected of you and do those expectations feel comfortable or like an unfair projection?
		- What is that you expect of others? Specifically, are your expectations rooted in compensating for actions you do not wish to do for yourself?
	- Becoming Mindful That You Are Projecting Expectations
		- Choosing to release these expectations as best as you can is game changer
		- Expectations are very engrained habit and will require conscious [[Anger]] pry them off you.
			- As an experiment try removing each expectation you notice with conscious Anger and throwing it into an [[Energetic Black Hole]].
		- Wisdom replaces "negativity" (as in negative-attracting pole force? As in I'm creating a "negative" attracting field with my Psychic Power?) as you come to trust the "truth" that you have no idea "what's really unfolding"
	- Grace
		- Divine influence; elegance of movement; good will
		- > Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness. It strikes us when we walk through the dark valley of a meaningless and empty life. It strikes us when our disgust for our own being, our indifference, our weakness, our hostility, and our lack of direction and composure have become intolerable to us. It strikes us when, year after year, the longed-for perfection of life does not appear, when the old compulsions reign within us as they have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage. Sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying, “You are accepted.” -- Paul Tillich
