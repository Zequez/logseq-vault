- Limitations of definitions
	- Wary of definitions;  precision means exclusion.
		- Dance around the edges of what a gift is.
- 3 characteristics
	- Sovereignty
		- Must involve some kind of free choice
	- Release
		- Release of control; we don't know wether or how it will come back to us.
		- From the perspective of a [[Separate Self]] giving is profoundly irrational
	- Relationship
		- In a real world gifts are usually witnessed, and they generate gratitude.
		- You can't say something isn't a gift because there are also selfish motives.
		- Creates and strengthens relationships and that distinguishes them from transactions and from barter.
		- Receiving a gift creates a kind of obligation
			- Not attractive to [[Separate Self]]; Separate Self does not want obligations; wants to be independent, not to own anyone anything.
			- This creates a reluctance to receive.
			- ### Receiving a gifts affirms your dependency on gifts; therefore it is an affront to delusion of independence
				- Invites us into greater dependency.
			- I don't owe anything; we remain separtae.
