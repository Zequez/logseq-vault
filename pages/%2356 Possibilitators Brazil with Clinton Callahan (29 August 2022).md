title:: #56 Possibilitators Brazil with Clinton Callahan (29 August 2022)

- We don't do [[Feedback]] anymore it is taken over by [[Gremlin]] too much. We do [[Proposals]].
- Proposals:
	- Being Guardian
	- Being Centered
- Who is going to be guardian for being centered then now?
	- Gabriela? Would you like to make sure we all have our center, grounding coord and bubble then?
		- Yes. I would like check if our [[Energetic Center]] is in our [[Physical Center]] right now, and on the count of 3 we say out loud the color of our [[Grounding Coord]] .
		- And with another clicker we click to our [[Personal Bubble]], that separates our personal informations from the world.
	- Alright, we have 4 guardians of distinctions, and we are ready to go.
- There is a kind of [[Ecstasy]] that comes [[Creating]].
	- The [[Possibilitator Training]] is only about Creating.
- We discovered in our [[Heal From School Lab]]  that everybody is still on [[School]].
	- Painful realization.
	- We come into Possibilitator Training and "it's not a bar, it's not a job, so it's gotta be school". There is so many places we can go to. The question is: "What are your practices for being out of School?"
		- Write in your [[Beep! Book]] for 3 minutes, what are your  [[Possibilitator Practices]]? The ones you are doing yesterday, today, and tomorrow. So we can talk about our Possibiliator Practices. It's not possible to practices 150 things at the same time; we need like 3 or 4. So write 3 or 4 practices that you are trying right now.
		- Clinton says that the practices for him are:
			- [[Having a Small Now]]
			- [[Making No Stories]]
			- [[Making No Assumptions]]
		- He tells a story:
			- There was a woman that was [[Projecting]] 100% her father and her ex-partner on him; she was screaming at him that it was all his fault, he was doing horrible things and that he was not a human being. With complete conviction enough to burn him at the stake.
				- This was from someone who has been practicing [[Possibility Management]] for 8 years; so she claimed.
			- To maintain the practice during that circumstance it's not an [[Easy]] thing; it's not an easy practice. {Maybe [[Hard]]?}
			- By their very nature practices are not easy.
			- Gave a talk about [[Goingo Orthogonal]] out of the ordinary space. He was talking about it as a [[Tool]] or a [[Practice]] so you don't get [[Hipnotized]] into the limitations of the current scape.
				- Lee Laz said "[[Practice]] is [[Orthogonal]] to the [[Space]]"
		- Asks for people to share what their practice is; and asks the 4 guardians please [[Stay Awake]].
		- Israel says:
			- [[Speaking From The Unknown]]
				- Starts to film videos without knowing what he will say.
				- [[Distinctions]] come up that are not usual for his [[Box]]; the Distinctions that he usually hit. He's going Orthogonal to the things that happen in his life.
		-
		- Clinton asks Gabriela how is it for her to be on the space of Israel when he's Speaking From The Unknown?
			- She was scared, because she's doing that practice too.
				- Big [[Fear]] comes up to her: "How can I integrate as a co-spaceholder to what he brings to the space?"
				- Practiced keeping her Center and the [[Presence]] in the [[Small Now]].
				- She realized that if she let her [[Fear]] come unconscious she started to [[Think]] about what he was saying and entering into [[Mental Mode]].
				- So she practiced to [[Using Fear Consciously]] to [[Navigate]] and [[Do The Next Step]]
		- Clinton asks Israel how was it not to use his mind as [[The Source]].
			- As Israel starts talking, Clinton interrupts him and makes a [[Proposal]].
				- There is a way when you [[Tell a Story]] to [[Put a Spin to a Story]]. It makes you smile, kinda look like a teenager and being excited and ecstatic. It makes it non-believable; makes us think you are in a [[Fantasy World]]; "You are doing the Israel thing again where everything is so amazing, so exciting"
				- So the Proposal is to tell the story without the spin. So use the same energy, loudness and Clarity, but the energetic spin without the smile on your face that looks like you are laughing at your own jokes.
					- Isreal accepts.
						- Clinton commits to being the guardian for this, and will make visual gesture in the screen if he notices he's doing it.
				- He was afraid too, and he ended the space with [[Joy]] for how Going from the Unknown in a space with Gabriela makes them it so much more [[Connected]]. Made it Easy to keep their centers, because it was not their Boxes that were relating. The space was being held from something that was not their Box.
		- Gabriela adds:
			- What comes is what the space needed.
