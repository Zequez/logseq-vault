title:: #56 Possibilitators Brazil with Clinton Callahan (29 August 2022)

- We don't do [[Feedback]] anymore it is taken over by [[Gremlin]] too much. We do [[Proposals]].
- Proposals:
	- Being Guardian
	- Being Centered
- Who is going to be guardian for being centered then now?
	- Gabriela? Would you like to make sure we all have our center, grounding coord and bubble then?
		- Yes. I would like check if our [[Energetic Center]] is in our [[Physical Center]] right now, and on the count of 3 we say out loud the color of our [[Grounding Coord]] .
		- And with another clicker we click to our [[Personal Bubble]], that separates our personal informations from the world.
	- Alright, we have 4 guardians of distinctions, and we are ready to go.
- There is a kind of [[Ecstasy]] that comes [[Creating]].
	- The [[Possibilitator Training]] is only about Creating.
- We discovered in our [[Heal From School Lab]]  that everybody is still on [[School]].
	- Painful realization.
	- We come into Possibilitator Training and "it's not a bar, it's not a job, so it's gotta be school". There is so many places we can go to. The question is: "What are your practices for [[Being Out Of School]]?"
		- Write in your [[Beep! Book]] for 3 minutes, what are your  [[Possibilitator Practices]]? The ones you are doing yesterday, today, and tomorrow. So we can talk about our Possibiliator Practices. It's not possible to practices 150 things at the same time; we need like 3 or 4. So write 3 or 4 practices that you are trying right now.
		- Clinton says that the practices for him are:
			- [[Having a Small Now]]
			- [[Making No Stories]]
			- [[Making No Assumptions]]
		- He shares a story:
			- There was a woman that was [[Projecting]] 100% her father and her ex-partner on him; she was screaming at him that it was all his fault, he was doing horrible things and that he was not a human being. With complete conviction enough to burn him at the stake.
				- This was from someone who has been practicing [[Possibility Management]] for 8 years; so she claimed.
			- To maintain the practice during that circumstance it's not an [[Easy]] thing; it's not an easy practice. {Maybe [[Hard]]?}
			- By their very nature practices are not easy.
			- Gave a talk about [[Goingo Orthogonal]] out of the ordinary space. He was talking about it as a [[Tool]] or a [[Practice]] so you don't get [[Hipnotized]] into the limitations of the current scape.
				- Lee Laz said "[[Practice]] is [[Orthogonal]] to the [[Space]]"
		- Asks for people to share what their practice is; and asks the 4 guardians please [[Stay Awake]].
		- Israel and Gabriela tell their story:
			- Israel says:
				- [[Speaking From The Unknown]]
					- Starts to film videos without knowing what he will say.
					- [[Distinctions]] come up that are not usual for his [[Box]]; the Distinctions that he usually hit. He's going Orthogonal to the things that happen in his life.
			- Clinton asks Gabriela how is it for her to be on the space of Israel when he's Speaking From The Unknown?
				- She was scared, because she's doing that practice too.
					- Big [[Fear]] comes up to her: "How can I integrate as a co-spaceholder to what he brings to the space?"
					- Practiced keeping her Center and the [[Presence]] in the [[Small Now]].
					- She realized that if she let her [[Fear]] come unconscious she started to [[Think]] about what he was saying and entering into [[Mental Mode]].
					- So she practiced to [[Using Fear Consciously]] to [[Navigate]] and [[Do The Next Step]]
			- Clinton asks Israel how was it not to use his mind as [[The Source]].
				- As Israel starts talking, Clinton interrupts him and makes a [[Proposal]].
					- There is a way when you [[Tell a Story]] to [[Put a Spin to a Story]]. It makes you smile, kinda look like a teenager and being excited and ecstatic. It makes it non-believable; makes us think you are in a [[Fantasy World]]; "You are doing the Israel thing again where everything is so amazing, so exciting"
					- So the Proposal is to tell the story without the spin. So use the same energy, loudness and Clarity, but the energetic spin without the smile on your face that looks like you are laughing at your own jokes.
						- Isreal accepts.
							- Clinton commits to being the guardian for this, and will make visual gesture in the screen if he notices he's doing it.
			- Israel tells his story:
				- He was afraid too, and he ended the space with [[Joy]] for how [[Speaking From The Unknown]] in a space with Gabriela made it much more [[Intimate]]. Made it Easy to keep their centers, because it was not their Boxes that were relating. The space was being held from something that was not their Box.
			- Gabriela adds:
				- What comes was fulfilling the [[Needs of the Space]].
			- Clinton summarizes:
				- They are you are telling him is an [[Experiment]] that he will share with other people.
					- If two people are [[Speaking From The Unknown]] even on [[Ordinary Life]] then it's not their [[Box]] relating anymore. So all of the sudden they get more [[Presence]] and more [[Intimacy]] because their boxes are not [[Speaking From the Known]] which causes [[Box Intimacy]].
					- And notes:
						- Even if one person is Speaking From The Unknown they are not so easy to be [[Hooked]]. Even if the other person can't yet Speak From The Unknown there is no reactivity between their boxes.
						- It's a very powerful experiment to keep trying.
		- Clinton asks who would like to share their practice next.
		- Marcelo shares his story:
			- He's practicing changing [[Identity]] to not be on [[Low Drama]] with his son and his wife. He learned that he can choose sometimes just to change; people feedback that people think he's crazy.
			- Marcelo is researching how to [[Change The Energy of a Space]]
			- Clinton asks what is the other energy he's trying to create.
			- It's the energy of [[Creation]] the energy of [[Discovery]], of [[Extraordinary Moments]] in their conversation, not [[Ordinary Moments]].
			- Clinton wants to ask a question:
				- Says that he thinks the spoon thing is a [[Gremlin Move]].
				- Talks about an exercise to do in couples of gazing into each other eyes. What what ends up happening is that they enter into [[Extraordinary Space]] but then they end up not talking anymore. And a lot of the work of [[Possibility Management]] is verbal is [[Using Words to Navigate]] [[Extraordinary Spaces]] and [[Archetypal Spaces]].
				- Asks Marcelo if he can give an example of how he could use words instead of spoon next time.
			- Marcelo shares an anecdote:
				- He's doing some videos about his business to get in contact with people who are participating on a workshop called [[Playcraft]] "I create what I play".
				- So he puts a skull mask and starts to talk from the enemy place.
					- Use the words of the enemy to talk about light and shadow and invite people to play with him.
			- Clinton shares an distinction about [[Navigating Space From The Being]]:
				- For further practice he encourages him to [[Use No Props]]. Unlike theater. The kind of space shifting where you take full responsibility has no props; you don't depend on an object to take people attention, you connect with the person and you speak open a [[Sideways Door]] in the space.
				- Tells story about a person that was great at improvisational theater, his characters were really interesting; but his ordinary person was really boring. So they gave him a challenge to play a character that would move for year to California and stay on that character at all time.
				- This practice gave him this [[Possibility]] of [[Using The Being To Shift Space]]. He was [[Navigating Space From The Being]].
				- There are many [[Invitations]] to go ordinary; but if you can Navigate Space From The Being you don't even have to fight against those forces, you simply don't go there; you are not going against what's there, you are going somewhere else.
					- Usually we go "I'm not doing this" "I'm not doing that"; you don't even have to engage the invitation to the [[Low Drama]].
			- Marcelo shares:
				- His son of 7-8 year of age is on the boy scouts, which is place with a lot of hierarchy. Clinton adds, like an army.
				- He wants to know how to be there and change the place, because it's important for his child to be in nature and it's the place they have in the city to do some things in the nature.
			- Clinton makes a distinction:
				- At that age is exactly the time where nature becomes important in children. There is a big shift from mother into nature.
				- In scouts you can make your own circle; your own patrol, your own group. His son could be the spaceholder. And they then focus on their specialty. So they specialty is to [[Connect With Nature]]. So they make a space, a [[Gameworld]] of their own.
					- Clinton mentions that he did that when he was on the boy scouts and it was [[Really Fun]], and they often got in trouble because they often were [[Breaking The Rules]].

		- Giovana tells her story.
			- She was holding space for a group, practicing experiences with their energetic bodies.
			- At the begging she started the process with [[Rage]] and the rest of the group had no [[Distinctions]] about it; they came from the context of [[New Age]] and [[Good Feelings / Bad Feelings]], and [[Bad Vibes / Good Vibes]].
			- They started saying yes/no from their [[Anger]]. She asked to let their Anger to say what they are. And it was [[Beautiful]].
			- Clinton says they are asking a different question: What is your practice?
			- She's practicing [[Being Centered]] and [[Unhookable]] when she's with her daughter. It was really difficult for her when she was entering into her drama when she started crying saying "I want this I want that" and was getting angry at her.
				- Now she's practicing Being Centered and being an Adult.
			- Clinton shares the distinction practice is something we do all the time; not just when we are with certain people. So he asks if she can be centered when she's on other difficult situations such as being in public.
			- Giovana agrees and says "I need to practice more"
			- Clinton interrupts her and indicates that by using that "I need to practice more" she would think that she's [[Being at School]]. Because there would be an assignment or an authority. But there are no assignments or authority in the group, they are a group of wizards sharing their practice, that's all.
				- "I need to practice more" is school bullshit. It's all an opportunity. It's all an experiment. It's all open space. You can do what you want for the rest of your life.
				- The question "What does it take to create and manage possibility?" It takes different practices in ordinary life. So they are just having a check in to what practices they are using. It's about being on an exciting adventure. Can you be unhookable on other places?
