title:: #56 Possibilitators Brazil with Clinton Callahan (29 August 2022)

- We don't do [[Feedback]] anymore it is taken over by [[Gremlin]] too much. We do [[Proposals]].
- Proposals:
	- Being Guardian
	- Being Centered
- Who is going to be guardian for being centered then now?
	- Gabriela? Would you like to make sure we all have our center, grounding coord and bubble then?
		- Yes. I would like check if our [[Energetic Center]] is in our [[Physical Center]] right now, and on the count of 3 we say out loud the color of our [[Grounding Coord]] .
		- And with another clicker we click to our [[Personal Bubble]], that separates our personal informations from the world.
	- Alright, we have 4 guardians of distinctions, and we are ready to go.
- There is a kind of [[Ecstasy]] that comes [[Creating]].
	- The [[Possibilitator Training]] is only about Creating.
- We discovered in our [[Heal From School Lab]]  that everybody is still on [[School]].
	- Painful realization.
	- We come into Possibilitator Training and "it's not a bar, it's not a job, so it's gotta be school". There is so many places we can go to. The question is: "What are your practices for being out of School?"
		- Write in your [[Beep! Book]] for 3 minutes, what are your  [[Possibilitator Practices]]? The ones you are doing yesterday, today, and tomorrow. So we can talk about our Possibiliator Practices. It's not possible to practices 150 things at the same time; we need like 3 or 4. So write 3 or 4 practices that you are trying right now.
		- Clinton says that the practices for him are:
			- [[Having a Small Now]]
			- [[Making No Stories]]
			- [[Making No Assumptions]]
		- He tells a story:
			- There was a woman that was [[Projecting]] 100% her father and her ex-partner on him; she was screaming at him that it was all his fault, he was doing horrible things and that he was not a human being. With complete conviction enough to burn him at the stake.
				- This was from someone who has been practicing [[Possibility Management]] for 8 years; so she claimed.
			- To maintain the practice during that circumstance it's not an [[Easy]] thing; it's not an easy practice. {Maybe [[Hard]]?}
			- By their very nature practices are not easy.
			- Gave a talk about [[Goingo Orthogonal]] out of the ordinary space. He was talking about it as a [[Tool]] or a [[Practice]] so you don't get [[Hipnotized]] into the limitations of the current scape.
				- Lee Laz said "[[Practice]] is [[Orthogonal]] to the [[Space]]"
		- Asks for people to share what their practice is; and asks the 4 guardians please [[Stay Awake]].
		- Israel says:
			- [[Speaking From The Unknown]]
				- Starts to film videos without knowing what he will say.
				- [[Distinctions]] come up that are not usual for his [[Box]]; the Distinctions that he usually hit. He's going Orthogonal to the things that happen in his life.
		-
		- Clinton asks Gabriela how is it for her to be on the space of Israel when he's Speaking From The Unknown?
			- She was scared, because she's doing that practice too.
				- Big fear comes up to her: "How can I integrate as a co-spaceholder to what he brings to the space?"
				- Practiced keeping her Center and the [[Presence]] in the [[Small Now]].
				- She realized that if she let her [[Fear]] come unconscious she started to [[Think]] about what he was saying and entering into [[Mental Mode]].
				- Keep using this Fear to
