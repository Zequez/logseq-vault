title:: #56 Possibilitators Brazil with Clinton Callahan (29 August 2022)

- We don't do [[Feedback]] anymore it is taken over by [[Gremlin]] too much. We do [[Proposals]].
- Proposals:
	- Being Guardian
	- Being Centered
- Who is going to be guardian for being centered then now?
	- Gabriela? Would you like to make sure we all have our center, grounding coord and bubble then?
		- Yes. I would like check if our [[Energetic Center]] is in our [[Physical Center]] right now, and on the count of 3 we say out loud the color of our [[Grounding Coord]] .
		- And with another clicker we click to our [[Personal Bubble]], that separates our personal informations from the world.
	- Alright, we have 4 guardians of distinctions, and we are ready to go.
- There is a kind of [[Ecstasy]] that comes [[Creating]].
	- The [[Possibilitator Training]] is only about Creating.
- We discovered in our [[Heal From School Lab]]  that everybody is still on [[School]].
	- Painful realization.
	- We come into Possibilitator Training and "it's not a bar, it's not a job, so it's gotta be school". There is so many places we can go to. The question is: "What are your practices for being out of School?"
		- Write in your [[Beep! Book]] for 3 minutes, what are your  [[Possibilitator Practices]]? The ones you are doing yesterday, today, and tomorrow. So we can talk about our Possibiliator Practices. It's not possible to practices 150 things at the same time; we need like 3 or 4. So write 3 or 4 practices that you are trying right now.
		- Clinton says that the practices for him are:
			- [[Having a Small Now]]
			- [[Making No Stories]]
			- [[Making No Assumptions]]
