- Every month I'm gathering a pile of money and giving it to someone because I'm afraid I will be forcefully removed from my home or some form of coercive force will be used on me against my will.
- How can I possibly see this as normal?
- Is it possible to be happy about giving a pile of money to someone else for no reason?

- I'm so afraid to lose my home that I don't quite dare to embrace it.
	- Walls that can be painted
	- Gardens that can be mindfully tended
