- Procedure for distilling the three, four or five [[Shadow Principles]] of your [[Hidden Purpose]].
- The process is horrendous. The term 'disillusionment' does not even come close to depicting what it feels like.
- Best done under the guidance of a skilled [[Underworld Navigator]] with absolute [[Clarity]].
- Once your Hidden Principles are distilled from the incidents and accidents of your life, it could take months or years to digest and integrate the experience into practical applications.
- All that you have, after distilling your Hidden Purpose is a way to detect who is in charge of what you are saying right now. That's a useful [[Distinction]].

- ## Experiment
	- Ask on Possibility Village Telegram group if anyone would help you distill the Shadow Principles of your Hidden Purpose with The Hidden Purpose Process.
