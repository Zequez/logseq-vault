- You take a paper and you scribble an idea with a pencil. In that [[Gameworld]], the Medium of [[Thought]] is your brain, your body, the paper, and the pencil. Here is a list of other Mediums of Thought:
	- A laptop
	- Photoshop
	- The Internet
	- [[Speaking Out Loud]]
	- [[Your Inner Monologe]]
	- Lego bricks
	- Paintbrush and canvas
	- Document
	- [[LogSeq]]
- Every Medium of Thought has a [[Context]]. Under a new Context, a [[Being]] has different [[Possibilities]] available. New [[Kinds of Thoughts]] can emerge in a different Medium of Thought.
- For example, right now on my current Medium of Thought, which is LogSeq, the Possibility of [[Streaming my Thought Process]] occurred to me. I feel fuzzy in the stomach about it. [[Fear]] of the implications; but with a sense of Joy. It's a [[New Idea]].
