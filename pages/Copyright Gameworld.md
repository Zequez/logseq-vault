- A [[Gameworld]] where people don't share their creations freely with everyone else.
- How to play Copyright:
	- Pretend that information is a scarce resource; ignore the fact that information is an energetic resource that can be copied and multiplied freely
	- Keep track about every piece of information that comes out of your [[Physical Body]] and claim that it was your sole creation. Ignore your Interconnectedness with everyone else and all the conditions that lead you to that moment.
