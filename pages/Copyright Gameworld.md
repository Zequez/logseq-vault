- A [[Gameworld]] where people don't share their creations freely with everyone else.
- How to play Copyright:
	- Pretend that information is a scarce resource; ignore the fact that information is an energetic resource that can be copied and multiplied freely
	- Keep track about every piece of information that comes out of your [[Physical Body]] and claim that it was your creation. Ignore your Interconnectedness with everyone else and everything that lead you to that last
	- they create with their [[Physical Body]] and ignore the inherent [[Interconnectedness Of All Life]] to claim the right to restrict access to information as if it's an scarce resource.
