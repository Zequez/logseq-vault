- These are notes on the [Living in the Gift course by Charles Eistenstein](https://charleseisenstein.org/courses/living-in-the-gift)
- Gratitude
	- The knowledge of having received a [[Gift]]
		- The consequent desire to give in turn by [[Expressing Your Gifts]].
	- The knowledge that [[Life is a Gift]], the knowledge of having received.
		- # Gratitude is my native state
- Life is a Gift
	- > Why does the sun shine? We did not earn the sun. It's not thanks to our hard efforts that the sun shines
	- Your life is a [[Gift]]; Your native state is [[Gratitude]]; the world is a gift, the cosmos operates on the principles of gift.
	- The knowledge that it is a gift, the knowledge of having received, the knowledge that you didn't earn your breath, your heartbeat, your blood, your conception, your... Your life is a gift. So Gratitude is your native state.
- Expressing Your Gifts
	- See [[Song of Anger]]
- Song of Anger
	- An unstoppable desire to develop and express your capacity to give to the world in [[Service]] of something that you care about
		- Can be repressed to some extent.
		- You were born to **sing your song**
		- Better than necessary for the grade, the boss, the market.
		- ### Yearning to make [[Art]] of your [[Work]], and your Work your Art.
		- The urge to [[Creating]] something [[Beautiful]]
		- Expand your capacities in doing their full potential in Service of something magnificent
	- If your gifts aren't met with receptivity you are going to want to get out of there.
- Scarcity
	- The scarcity and the struggle are very much artificial and systemic. They have a systemic dimension and an internal dimension creating additional struggle that’s not even built into the system and not built into the course of a normal life.
- Ease and leisure
	- Is this part of the fabric of life or are these just interruptions in a normalized reality of scarcity?

- What is a [[Gift]]?
	- Limitations of definitions
		- Wary of definitions;  precision means exclusion.
			- Dance around the edges of what a gift is.
	- 3 characteristics
		- Sovereignty
			- Must involve some kind of free choice
		- Release
			- Release of control; we don't know wether or how it will come back to us.
			- From the perspective of a [[Separate Self]] giving is profoundly irrational
		- Relationship
			- In a real world gifts are usually witnessed, and they generate gratitude.
			- You can't say something isn't a gift because there are also selfish motives.
			- Creates and strengthens relationships and that distinguishes them from transactions and from barter.
			- Receiving a gift creates a kind of obligation
				- Not attractive to [[Separate Self]]; Separate Self does not want obligations; wants to be independent, not to own anyone anything.
				- This creates a reluctance to receive.
				- ### Receiving a gifts affirms your dependency on gifts; therefore it is an affront to delusion of independence
					- Invites us into greater dependency.
				- I don't owe anything; we remain separtae.
	- Living in the Gifts is a step into another story of the world, another self, another reality.
		- Loss of control is compensated by a feeling of greater belonging, greater connection.
		- This is not a formula or a path with a map.
	- Releasing Boundaries
		- Sometimes it is appropriate to refuse a gift if you don’t want that relationship and you don’t
		  want to release that boundary.
		- Gifts is fundamentally about a release of control and stepping into trust, giving into mystery.
		- Releasing control on the giving side
			- Release of making sure you get a result for your investment
		- Releasing control on the receiving side
			- Release of staying independent
		- Recognize readiness to what form of control are you ready to release.
		- Any release of control is a step into gift.
	- # What form of control are you ready to let go of?

- Life and play had migrated indoors out of the public realm into the private realm
	- Cooking club was not helpig to meet any of their real needs; it fell into the category of Leisure.
		- We didn't really need each other.
			- We are all plugged into the money economy and we meet all our needs with money.
	- Community is woven from gifts.
		- Gifts are the warp; stories the woof
		- Everybydy is in debt with everyone else
		- Disintegration of community
			- It has essentially been strip mined; the gift relationships have been turned into goods and services we can buy
		- The more developed a country is the more community is broken down
			- Rural people and the poor tend to have mor community than the affluent.
		- Commitment to an aim beyond themselves
			- > I propose that that aim should be to repair, regenerate and beautify our hurting planet, to heal its ecological and social trauma. That is something we can all give our gifts toward.
		- "We are in it together"
		- Polarization as a symptom of the breakdown of community
		- You can't have "community" be the motivation for community; there has to be some other aim we are willing to commit to.
	- # We are in this Together
		- "On some level this person is an ally"
