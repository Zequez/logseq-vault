- Gratitude
	- Gratitude is the knowledge of having received and the consequent desire to give in turn.
	- Better than neccesary for the grade
	- Why does the sun shine?
	- Your life is a gift; Your native state is gratitude
		- The knowledeg that it is a gift, the knowledge of having received.
	- ## Gratitude is my native state
- Life is a gift
	- > "We did not earn the sun. It's not thanks to our hard efforts that the sun shines"
-
- Expressing your gifts
	- an unstoppable desire to develop and express your capacity to give to the world in service of
	  something that you care about.
- Scarcity
	- The scarcity and the struggle are very much artificial and systemic. They have a systemic dimension and an internal dimension creating additional struggle thatâ€™s not even built into the system and not built into the course of a normal life.
