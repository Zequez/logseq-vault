- Sovereignty, Release and Relationship
	- Books
		- The Gift by Lewis Hyde
		- Debts: The First 5000 Years by David Graeber
	- What is a [[Gift]]?
	- Living in the Gifts is a step into another story of the world, another self, another reality.
		- Loss of control is compensated by a feeling of greater belonging, greater connection.
		- This is not a formula or a path with a map.
# What form of control are you ready to let go of?

- Community
	- The Money Economy
		- > Life and play had migrated indoors out of the public realm into the private realm
		- > Cooking club was not helping to meet any of their real needs; it fell into the category of Leisure.
		- > We didn't really need each other.
		- > We are all plugged into the money economy and we meet all our needs with money.
	- Community is woven from gifts.
		- Gifts are the warp; stories the woof
		- Everybydy is in debt with everyone else
		- Disintegration of community
			- It has essentially been strip mined; the gift relationships have been turned into goods and services we can buy
		- The more developed a country is the more community is broken down
			- Rural people and the poor tend to have mor community than the affluent.
		- Commitment to an aim beyond themselves
			- > I propose that that aim should be to repair, regenerate and beautify our hurting planet, to heal its ecological and social trauma. That is something we can all give our gifts toward.
		- "We are in it together"
		- Polarization as a symptom of the breakdown of community
		- You can't have "community" be the motivation for community; there has to be some other aim we are willing to commit to.
		- # We are in this Together
			- "On some level this person is an ally"
