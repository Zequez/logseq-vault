- ---
- Sovereignty, Release and Relationship
	- Books
		- The Gift by Lewis Hyde
		- Debts: The First 5000 Years by David Graeber
	- What is a [[Gift]]?
	- Living in the Gift is a step into another story of the world, another self, another reality.
		- Loss of control is compensated by a feeling of greater belonging, greater connection.
		- This is not a formula or a path with a map.

- Trust that only makes sense if the Universe is generous
- Any small thing I do creates a ripple effect
- Citrus makes you feel good after throwing up
- When I'm giving it creates a transformation in me
- 3 stages
	- Giving
	- Realize I'm receiving
	- Dancing; you don't keep track
- Bigger sense of I
	- Paradox; be selfish be generous; selfish for this giant whole that is truly our identity
- "Breath, be here, we are not giving and receiving, we're dancing as a whole"
- Gratitude is the source of Generosity
- We're always receiving way more than what we are contributing with our [[Finite Egos]]
- Identifying what masks gratitude, what keeps us away from the native state
	- Lack of awareness
	- Suspend your idea about what is valuable (market sense)
	- How do you get on that state of realizing that we are all receiving?
	- Potential of my heart to give, can get bigger
		- Faith in the capacity of the heart
		- We can always expand our hearts; it's not easy but it's possible.
	- Each expansion of the heart you enter into a new territory
		- Is this safe, am I ready for the next stage?
- The most powerful people could be anyone
	- Ripple effect can influence immensely
- Suspend attachment to outcome; you don't kow
