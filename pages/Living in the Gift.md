- These are notes on the [Living in the Gift course by Charles Eistenstein](https://charleseisenstein.org/courses/living-in-the-gift)
- Gratitude
	- Gratitude is the knowledge of having received and the consequent desire to give in turn.
	- Better than neccesary for the grade
	- Why does the sun shine?
	- Your life is a gift; Your native state is gratitude; the world is a gift, the cosmos operates on the principles of gift.
		- The knowledge that it is a gift, the knowledge of having received.
	- # Gratitude is my native state
		- The knowledge that it is a gift, the knowledge of having received, the knowledge that you didn't earn your breath, your heartbeat, your blood, your conception, your... Your life is a gift. So gratitude is your native state.
- Life is a gift
	- > "We did not earn the sun. It's not thanks to our hard efforts that the sun shines"
-
- Expressing your gifts
	- If your gifts aren't met with receptivity you are going to want to get out of there.
	- An unstoppable desire to develop and express your capacity to give to the world in service of
	  something that you care about.
- Scarcity
	- The scarcity and the struggle are very much artificial and systemic. They have a systemic dimension and an internal dimension creating additional struggle that’s not even built into the system and not built into the course of a normal life.
- Ease and leisure
	- Is this part of the fabric of life or are these just interruptions in a normalized reality of scarcity?
- Your Song
	- You were born to sign it; whatever your song is.
	- Better than necessary for the grade, the boss, the market.
		- ### Yearning to make art of your work, and your work your art.
		- Urge to create something beautiful
		- Expand your capacities in doing their full potential in service of something magnificent

- What is a gift?
	- Limitations of definitions
		- Wary of definitions;  precision means exclusion.
			- Dance around the edges of what a gift is.
	- 3 characteristics
		- Sovereignty
			- Must involve some kind of free choice
		- Release
			- Release of control; we don't know wether or how it will come back to us.
			- From the perspective of a [[Separate Self]] giving is profoundly irrational
		- Relationship
			- In a real world gifts are usually witnessed, and they generate gratitude.
			- You can't say something isn't a gift because there are also selfish motives.
			- Creates and strengthens relationships and that distinguishes them from transactions and from barter.
			- Receiving a gift creates a kind of obligation
				- Not attractive to [[Separate Self]]; Separate Self does not want obligations; wants to be independent, not to own anyone anything.
				- This creates a reluctance to receive.
				- ### Receiving a gifts affirms your dependency on gifts; therefore it is an affront to delusion of independence
					- Invites us into greater dependency.
				- I don't owe anything; we remain separtae.
	- Living in the Gifts is a step into another story of the world, another self, anotherreality.
		- Loss of control is compensated by a feeling of greater belonging, greater connection.
		- This is not a formula or a path with a map.
	- Releasing Boundaries
		- Sometimes it is appropriate to refuse a gift if you don’t want that relationship and you don’t
		  want to release that boundary.
		- Gifts is fundamentally about a release of control and stepping into trust, giving into mystery.
		- Releasing control on the giving side
			- Release of making sure you get a result for your investment
		- Releasing control on the receiving side
			- Release of staying independent
		- Recognize readiness to what form of control are you ready to release.
		- Any release of control is a step into gift.
	- # What form of control are you ready to let go of?

- Life and play had migrated indoors out of the public realm into the private realm
	- Cooking club was not helpig to meet any of their real needs; it fell into the category of Leisure.
		- We didn't really need each other.
			- We are all plugged into the money economy and we meet all our needs with money.
	- Community is woven from gifts.
		- Gifts are the warp; stories the woof
		- Everybydy is in debt with everyone else
		- Disintegration of community
			- It has essentially been strip mined; the gift relationships have been turned into goods and services we can buy
		- The more developed a country is the more community is broken down
			- Rural people and the poor tend to have mor community than the affluent.
