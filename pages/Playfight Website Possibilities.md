- ### Context
	- Nada Elissa contacted me regarding the [Playfight.org new website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10B2i4CknKOptbheR2LPve2CaFi6ivzxhf3WrS4JaHMI/edit#) that includes many new features.
		- > Playfight is a Body Practice that supports people to reconnect with their bodies and with other people in a natural way. Playfight is based on an international network of Facilitators that offer different events around the globe.
		- > Playfight.org is a non profit organisation that aims to guarantee the quality of the work done under the name of Playfight.
		- > Currently in order to support the community of Facilitators for their work and the coherence of the work itself we aim to have a new website that every facilitator can use and for anyone interested in Playfight to refer to.

- Goals
-
- There are multiple paths for building the new website, each one with its benefits and drawbacks.
	- ### Using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
		- Maintenance cost
			- On Wordpress.com $25/month to be able to install plugins and install themes
				- Also about $25 on other managed Wordpress hosting solutions such as [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/pricing/) or [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/plans/)
		- #### Benefits
			- It's free and open source software
			- Whatever you build here can be exported to somewhere else; you own all the code and tools
			- Has a large amount of plugins systems with many functionalities
		- #### Drawbacks
			- It's not a whole platform by itself, even with plugins, custom code still needs to be written and maintained by someone with coding skills on a code editor elsewhere and deployed to a hosting provider.
			- It was originally made for blogging and it's general-use platform now; it's cluttered with a lot of things that wouldn't actually be used.
			-
			-
	- ### Using [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) web app builder
		- Maintenance cost
			- $115/month for professional version which allow for adding collaborators to app
		- #### Benefits
			- Fully no-code platform, the entire platform is creating and maintained without any coding skills
			- Very exciting new technology that I would like to study further
		- #### Drawbacks
			- I've never used it
			- It's a closed platform; app can only be run there and cannot be exported elsewhere
			- Translation is done by a separate service called [Localize.js](https://localizejs.com/) that's [very pricy](https://localizejs.com/pricing).
	- ### Using [Wix Velo](https://www.wix.com/velo/) web app builder
		- Maintenance cost
			- $12.50/month ($25/month for priority customer support); the same as for regular Wix websites; which is surprisingly cheap
		- ### Benefits
			- Uses the Wix website editor which is one of the best available
			- Low code platform; can edit visually but has complete code editing capabilities right in the browser
			- Translations are included in the Wix arsenal of tools, no external tool needed
			- I'm very excited about building on this platform
		- ### Drawbacks
			- As with Bubble, I've never used it
			- As with Bubble, it's a closed platform; app exists at Wix and cannot be exported elsewhere
	- ### Creating a platform with common coding tools
		- Stack of tools that would be used
			- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as backend
			- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as hosting platform
			- Frontend tooling
				- [Astro](https://astro.build/) as builder
				- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for making components
				- [GrapeJS](https://grapesjs.com) as visual page editor
			- Custom code to tie it all together
		- Maintenance cost
			- $0 while the app stays within the limits of free options; which is quite high.
			- Supabase is the most likely to hit the limit, then it's  [$25/month](https://supabase.com/pricing)
			- Very unlikely that limits are hit on Vercel, if it did, it would be [$20/month](https://vercel.com/pricing)
		- #### Benefits
			- Most flexible
			- Highest ego inflation; I assert myself as a true programmer ðŸ¤£
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Highest complexity; many moving parts that need to be tied together
			- Requires a diverse spectrum of high-level skills for the maintenance and updating of the app itself
			- Template editing with GrapeJS is lacking in comparison to commercial platforms such as Strikingly, Webflow or Bubble; and needs a lot of integration code (GrapeJS by itself does not do much)
			-
	- ### Alternative web architecture
		- How would it work
			- I organize a workshop for every facilitator to learn how to build and maintain their own websites with events using free no-code tools
				- Every facilitator has its own personal website at the end of the workshop
				- Events are handled by facilitators themselves in their websites with a agreed-upon protocol
				- Facilitator profiles pages are completely customizable and can be either embedded into Playfight.org or linked to their website instead
				- Facilitators decide what languages their profile is written on
			- Headless backend is build with components that facilitators can include in their website
				- Shared visitors authentication with Playfight.org
				- Embeddable events component for both managing and displaying events on their website
			- The data is distributed, so the platform collects data from each facilitator website to create the collection of events
			- The platform website is developed collaboratively by each facilitator with the same tools used to build their websites
			- Non-facilitators membership and events registration would still need a backend
			- Might be able to use peer-to-peer [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) for backend
		- #### Benefits
			- Highest resonance with [[Archiarchy]] values
			- Very exciting
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Has never been done; it's an experiment
			- Neither Holochain nor [Holo.host](https://holo.host/) (a web hosting platform for Holochain apps) are public ready; so we would still need to use an alternative backend in the meantime
			- A lot of moving parts, very complex
			- Alright, this idea is not practical, I admit it; I still want to organize the workshop
			- Would need separate research and even building things to be able to enable people to use free no-code tools to build their website
			- An entire whitepaper would need to be written to actually make this doable
			-
	- #### Headless backend with web components that can be embedded into existing websites
		- Very similar to "Creating platform with custom code tools"; except the page design would be offloaded to one of the popular website builders
		- #### Benefits
			- For the page building you can use whatever you want; Mystrikingly, Webflow, Wix...
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Lots of moving parts; needs a lot of custom coding and even a backend, users memberships, everything.

- # Conclusion of exploration
	- I believe the most effective path is to use Wix Velo to build the platform. It's very powerful and flexible. Has little maintenance cost. Has database managing right into the platform. It's looks really good to build on, and it would be the quickest and easiest to maintain.
	- Let's split the features into parts and create a rough roadmap with 2-weeks milestones
		- Profile page for each facilitator
		- Event page for each event
		- Calendar view of events in chronological order and with filtering by event type and location
		- Facilitators page
		-
	- Here is a rough roadmap:
