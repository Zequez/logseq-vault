- ### Context
	- Nada Elissa contacted me regarding the [Playfight.org new website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10B2i4CknKOptbheR2LPve2CaFi6ivzxhf3WrS4JaHMI/edit#) that includes many new features.
		- > Playfight is a Body Practice that supports people to reconnect with their bodies and with other people in a natural way. Playfight is based on an international network of Facilitators that offer different events around the globe.
		- > Playfight.org is a non profit organisation that aims to guarantee the quality of the work done under the name of Playfight.
		- > Currently in order to support the community of Facilitators for their work and the coherence of the work itself we aim to have a new website that every facilitator can use and for anyone interested in Playfight to refer to.

- There are multiple paths for building the new website, each one with it's benefits and drawbacks.
-
- ### Using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- ### Using [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) web app builder
	- Maintenance cost: $115/month for professional version which allow for adding collaborators to app
- ### Creating a platform with common coding tools
	- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as backend
	- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as hosting platform
	- Frontend tooling
		- [Astro](https://astro.build/) as builder
		- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for making components
		- [GrapeJS](https://grapesjs.com) as visual page editor
	- Custom code to tie it all together
	- #### Maintenance
		- $0 while the app stays within the limits of free options; which is quite high.
		- Supabase is the most likely to hit the limit, then it's  [$25/month](https://supabase.com/pricing)
		- Very unlikely that limits are hit on Vercel, if it did, it would be [$20/month](https://vercel.com/pricing)
	- #### Benefits
		- Most flexible
	- #### Drawbacks
		- Highest complexity
		-
		-
- ### Alternative web architecture
	- Every facilitator has their own personal website
		- Events are handled by facilitators themselves in their websites with a agreed-upon protocol
	- #### Benefits
		- Highest resonance with [[Archiarchy]] values
		- Most exciting
	- #### Drawbacks
		- Has never been done; it's an experiment
