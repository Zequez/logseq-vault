- ### Using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- ### Using [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) web app builder
	- Maintenance cost: $115/month for professional version which allow for adding collaborators to app

	- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as hosting platform
	- Frontend tooling

	- Custom code to tie it all together
	- #### Maintenance
		- $0 while the app stays within the limits of free options; which is quite high.
