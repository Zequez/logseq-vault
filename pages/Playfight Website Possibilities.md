- ### Context
	- Nada Elissa contacted me regarding the [Playfight.org new website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10B2i4CknKOptbheR2LPve2CaFi6ivzxhf3WrS4JaHMI/edit#) that includes many new features.
		- > Playfight is a Body Practice that supports people to reconnect with their bodies and with other people in a natural way. Playfight is based on an international network of Facilitators that offer different events around the globe.
		- > Playfight.org is a non profit organisation that aims to guarantee the quality of the work done under the name of Playfight.
		- > Currently in order to support the community of Facilitators for their work and the coherence of the work itself we aim to have a new website that every facilitator can use and for anyone interested in Playfight to refer to.

- Goals
-
- There are multiple paths for building the new website, each one with its benefits and drawbacks.
	- ### Using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
	- ### Using [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) web app builder
		- Maintenance cost: $115/month for professional version which allow for adding collaborators to app
		- #### Benefits
			- Fully no-code platform, the entire platform is creating and maintained without any coding skills
			- Very exciting new technology that I would like to study further
		- #### Drawbacks
			- I've never used it
	- ### Creating a platform with common coding tools
		- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as backend
		- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as hosting platform
		- Frontend tooling
			- [Astro](https://astro.build/) as builder
			- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for making components
			- [GrapeJS](https://grapesjs.com) as visual page editor
		- Custom code to tie it all together
		- #### Maintenance
			- $0 while the app stays within the limits of free options; which is quite high.
			- Supabase is the most likely to hit the limit, then it's  [$25/month](https://supabase.com/pricing)
			- Very unlikely that limits are hit on Vercel, if it did, it would be [$20/month](https://vercel.com/pricing)
		- #### Benefits
			- Most flexible
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Highest complexity; many moving parts that need to be tied together
			- Requires a diverse spectrum of high-level skills for the maintenance and updating of the app itself
			- Template editing with GrapeJS is lacking in comparison to commercial platforms such as Strikingly, Webflow or Bubble; and needs a lot of integration code (Grap)
			-
			-
	- ### Alternative web architecture
		- Every facilitator has their own personal website
			- Events are handled by facilitators themselves in their websites with a agreed-upon protocol
		- #### Benefits
			- Highest resonance with [[Archiarchy]] values
			- Most exciting
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Has never been done; it's an experiment
