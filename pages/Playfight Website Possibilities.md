- # Context
	- Nada Elissa contacted me regarding the [Playfight.org new website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10B2i4CknKOptbheR2LPve2CaFi6ivzxhf3WrS4JaHMI/edit#) that includes many new features.
		- > Playfight is a Body Practice that supports people to reconnect with their bodies and with other people in a natural way. Playfight is based on an international network of Facilitators that offer different events around the globe.
		- > Playfight.org is a non profit organisation that aims to guarantee the quality of the work done under the name of Playfight.
		- > Currently in order to support the community of Facilitators for their work and the coherence of the work itself we aim to have a new website that every facilitator can use and for anyone interested in Playfight to refer to.
- # Web-building Options Exploration
	- There are multiple paths for building the new website, each one with its benefits and drawbacks.
	- ### Using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
		- Maintenance cost
			- On Wordpress.com $25/month to be able to install plugins and install themes
				- Also about $25 on other managed Wordpress hosting solutions such as [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/pricing/) or [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/plans/)
		- #### Benefits
			- It's free and open source software
			- Whatever you build here can be exported to somewhere else; you own all the code and tools
			- Has a large amount of plugins systems with many functionalities
		- #### Drawbacks
			- It's not a whole platform by itself, even with plugins, custom code still needs to be written and maintained by someone with coding skills on a code editor elsewhere and deployed to a hosting provider.
			- It was originally made for blogging and it's general-use platform now; it's cluttered with a lot of things that wouldn't actually be used.
			-
			-
	- ### Using [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) web app builder
		- Maintenance cost
			- $115/month for professional version which allow for adding collaborators to app
		- #### Benefits
			- Fully no-code platform, the entire platform is creating and maintained without any coding skills
			- Very exciting new technology that I would like to study further
		- #### Drawbacks
			- I've never used it
			- It's a closed platform; app can only be run there and cannot be exported elsewhere
			- Translation is done by a separate service called [Localize.js](https://localizejs.com/) that's [very pricy](https://localizejs.com/pricing).
	- ### Using [Wix Velo](https://www.wix.com/velo/) web app builder
		- Maintenance cost
			- $12.50/month ($25/month for priority customer support); the same as for regular Wix websites; which is surprisingly cheap
		- ### Benefits
			- Uses the Wix website editor which is one of the best available
			- Low code platform; can edit visually but has complete code editing capabilities right in the browser
			- Translations are included in the Wix arsenal of tools, no external tool needed
			- I'm very excited about building on this platform
		- ### Drawbacks
			- As with Bubble, I've never used it
			- As with Bubble, it's a closed platform; app exists at Wix and cannot be exported elsewhere
	- ### Creating a platform with common coding tools
		- Stack of tools that would be used
			- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as backend
			- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as hosting platform
			- Frontend tooling
				- [Astro](https://astro.build/) as builder
				- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for making components
				- [GrapeJS](https://grapesjs.com) as visual page editor
			- Custom code to tie it all together
		- Maintenance cost
			- $0 while the app stays within the limits of free options; which is quite high.
			- Supabase is the most likely to hit the limit, then it's  [$25/month](https://supabase.com/pricing)
			- Very unlikely that limits are hit on Vercel, if it did, it would be [$20/month](https://vercel.com/pricing)
		- #### Benefits
			- Most flexible
			- Highest ego inflation; I assert myself as a true programmer ðŸ¤£
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Highest complexity; many moving parts that need to be tied together
			- Requires a diverse spectrum of high-level skills for the maintenance and updating of the app itself
			- Template editing with GrapeJS is lacking in comparison to commercial platforms such as Strikingly, Webflow or Bubble; and needs a lot of integration code (GrapeJS by itself does not do much)
			-
	- ### Alternative web architecture
		- How would it work
			- I organize a workshop for every facilitator to learn how to build and maintain their own websites with events using free no-code tools
				- Every facilitator has its own personal website at the end of the workshop
				- Events are handled by facilitators themselves in their websites with a agreed-upon protocol
				- Facilitator profiles pages are completely customizable and can be either embedded into Playfight.org or linked to their website instead
				- Facilitators decide what languages their profile is written on
			- Headless backend is build with components that facilitators can include in their website
				- Shared visitors authentication with Playfight.org
				- Embeddable events component for both managing and displaying events on their website
			- The data is distributed, so the platform collects data from each facilitator website to create the collection of events
			- The platform website is developed collaboratively by each facilitator with the same tools used to build their websites
			- Non-facilitators membership and events registration would still need a backend
			- Might be able to use peer-to-peer [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) for backend
		- #### Benefits
			- Highest resonance with [[Archiarchy]] values
			- Very exciting
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Has never been done; it's an experiment
			- Neither Holochain nor [Holo.host](https://holo.host/) (a web hosting platform for Holochain apps) are public ready; so we would still need to use an alternative backend in the meantime
			- A lot of moving parts, very complex
			- Alright, this idea is not practical, I admit it; I still want to organize the workshop
			- Would need separate research and even building things to be able to enable people to use free no-code tools to build their website
			- An entire whitepaper would need to be written to actually make this doable
			-
	- #### Headless backend with web components that can be embedded into existing websites
		- Very similar to "Creating platform with custom code tools"; except the page design would be offloaded to one of the popular website builders
		- #### Benefits
			- For the page building you can use whatever you want; Mystrikingly, Webflow, Wix...
		- #### Drawbacks
			- Lots of moving parts; needs a lot of custom coding and even a backend, users memberships, everything.

- # Conclusion of exploration
	- I believe the most effective path is to use Wix Velo to build the platform. It's very powerful and flexible. Has little maintenance cost. Has database managing right into the platform. It's looks really good to build on, and it would be the quickest and easiest to maintain.
- # Roadmap
	- Let's split the features into parts and create a rough roadmap with 2-weeks milestones; or sprints, as they are called on the industry-lingo.
		- ### Stage 1: Working prototype
			- Basic homepage with navigation
			- Facilitators page
			- Profile page for each facilitator, with list of events
			- Profile editing page for each facilitator, with links to event editing
			- Events page
				- Calendar view of events in chronological order
				- Filtering by event type and location
				- Show map with events locations?
				  background-color:: yellow
			- Event page for each event
			- Event editing page
			- Facilitators registration form
			- Admins can edit any facilitator page and events
			- Web app published accessible
		- ### Stage 2: Visitors members
			- Visitors registration page
			- Event registration page
				- Add membership sign in / sign up if not logged in
				- Just event registration if already authenticated
			- Member page with their events and information
			- Page layout with either member name/avatar
		- ### Stage 3: Polishing
			- Translation to other languages
			- Feature-parity with existing Strikingly site
			- Integration with Hub Spot
			- Other optional or additional features
		- ### Stage 4: Maintenance and updates
			- Nothing specific, just ongoing long-term support
			-
		-
- # Funding
	- I'm requesting $600 investment for starting Stage 1
	- Then after finishing each subsequent stage (1, 2 and 3) I will prompt for additional contribution

- # Response to Matteo message
	- ### On propietary vs open source platforms
		- I resonate with the concern of Wix being a proprietary platform. Personally, from what I've seen Wix Velo is very flexible in the sense that you can write arbitrary code from it, so it's unlikely that we'll hit a wall. In a sense it's similar to tools like [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) where the whole development environment is cloud-based; but leveraging Wix visual page editor for the pages design.
			- Having a cloud-based development environment has the advantage that contributors don't need a local version of the app and setting up a local server, a local database, and a deployment workflow, which can be quite complex as of itself. So it's very easy to take the reins of the project, as you don't need to install anything on your computer or know about development operations.
				- Elementor Cloud would be quite a contender for this.
		- For a long time I have struggled with the issue of using proprietary vs free and open source software.
			- I used to be a little moralistic about open source software vs proprietary. However I've started to change my mind about recently.
				- Just because something is open source does not mean it's open to everyone; just to the ones that understand the code. Using no-code platforms encourages accessibility. From practical perspective, we don't have practical access nor could we understand most of the code that runs the web as a whole, and yet we use it and we don't think about it. Open source is a story.
				- If we're all essentially on the same team, and people in a company created a proprietary software; nothing stops us from being on their team and advocating for them open sourcing their software. This has happened in the past and there are many companies develop open source software and usually the way they fund themselves is by offering hosting services specifically tailored for their platform. That's how Wordpress works for example, or the Discourse forum platform.
					- I do believe that as humanity transitions into Archiarchy and we all start working together as a team, companies will transform from the inside out into the emerging collaborative context. This is mostly why I'm not that concerned anymore about proprietary platforms.
	- ### About Elementor and additional Wordpress plugins
		- All said and done, I'm exploring right now the Elementor plugin that you mentioned. It seems it has many similarities with the Wordpress block editor, which also allows you to design pages within Wordpress.
			- As I was researching I found a plugin called [WPIDE](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpide/) which allows you to edit the Wordpress code from within Wordpress itself. This puts it in line with some capabilities of Wix Velo. I'm going to be exploring it also.
	- ### About Wordpress hosting
		- Regarding the Wordpress platform. I cited Wordpress.com because I'm assuming it's a managed Wordpress hosting from the same team that works on the core Wordpress.org software; so they fund the Wordpress development by offering managed Wordpress hosting. I know [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) does this for example. I'm aware there are many options for hosting Wordpress that might be a better alternative. In that sense it's quite flexible because there are many hosting providers. Elementor Cloud is definitely a great alternative.
	- ### About Velo using JavaScript
		- Regarding the concern about Velo using JavaScript, I think it might be a misconception. The only heavy use of JavaScript on Velo is on the app editor, the app itself works as a normal web, same as Wordpress, mostly HTML and CSS, and JavaScript used for dynamic content; I don't believe performance would be an issue.
