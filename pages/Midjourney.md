- They are the team to generating digital images what LogSeq is the team to creating a thinking environment
- Attempts at directing the AI:
	- Human with raised arms energetic body overlapping physical body in a held space
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248231256_0.png)
		- Super creepy, not what I had in mind
	- Circle of people sitting around in a solarpunk village setting
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248304218_0.png)
		- Ok I see how that instruction might be misinterpreted
	- People sitting in a circle in nature
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248329453_0.png)
		- Alright, that's a little closer to what I had in mind. Give me variations of V1

	- Emotional body expanding from heart of humanoid shape in psychedelic space, Alex Grey style

	- Bright fantasy world inside head of person in sorrowful environment

		- I accidentally asked for variations on V4
