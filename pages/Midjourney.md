- It's a sort of AI service for computer generated imagination pictures based on human prompted terms.
- All these images were generated by computer AI guided by human.

- They are the team to generating digital images what LogSeq is the team to creating a thinking environment
- Attempts at directing the AI:
	- Human with raised arms energetic body overlapping physical body in a held space
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248231256_0.png)
		- Super creepy, not what I had in mind
	- Emotional body expanding from heart of humanoid shape in psychedelic space, Alex Grey style
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248166160_0.png)
		- Pretty good, interesting that the style direction worked quite well. The images still feel a little creepy
	- Circle of people sitting around in a solarpunk village setting
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248304218_0.png)
		- Ok I see how that instruction might be misinterpreted
	- People sitting in a circle in nature
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248329453_0.png)
		- Alright, that's a little closer to what I had in mind. Give me variations of N1
