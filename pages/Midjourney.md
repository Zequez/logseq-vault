- It's a sort of AI service for computer generated imagination pictures based on human prompted terms.
- All these images were generated by computer AI guided by human.

- They are the team to generating digital images what LogSeq is the team to creating a thinking environment
- Attempts at directing the AI:
	- Human with raised arms energetic body overlapping physical body in a held space
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248231256_0.png)
		- Super creepy, not what I had in mind
	- Circle of people sitting around in a solarpunk village setting
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248304218_0.png)
		- Ok I see how that instruction might be misinterpreted
	- People sitting in a circle in nature
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248329453_0.png)
		- Alright, that's a little closer to what I had in mind. Give me variations of V1
		  ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248386907_0.png)
		- Pretty cool stuff
	- [[Digital Garden]]
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248407686_0.png)
	- Emotional body expanding from heart of humanoid shape in psychedelic space, Alex Grey style
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248166160_0.png)
		- Pretty good, interesting that the style direction worked quite well. The images still feel a little creepy
	- Bright fantasy world inside head of person in sorrowful environment
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248481504_0.png)
		- I accidentally asked for variations on V4
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248508432_0.png)
			- It looks very dark, I wanted more emphasis on the fantasy world
	- Fractal pattern of colorful beings that cover the surface of the Earth
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248583406_0.png)
		- Not what I had in mind, but curious about what can be done. Variations for \#4
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248637351_0.png)
			- A little more of the same, but let's pick again \#4
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248660295_0.png)
				- Does not look like it's gonna get much better
	- Going through a portal out of patriarchy
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666248979178_0.png)
		- I don't think patriarchy was well despicted here, it probably does not understand what patriarchy is
	- Going through a magical portal out of a violent environment into an earth goddess arms
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666249038329_0.png)
		- Mmm, a little better but not quite
	- Going through a magical gateway out of a busy city into a colorful green landscape
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666249179180_0.png)
		- Now this is quite nice, let's ask for variations in \#4
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666249230495_0.png)
			- Ok I'm done. I think it's amazing what a computer can make on the fly.
			- And I'm curious about this technology will unleash.
