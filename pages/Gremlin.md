- > Let's say that your Gremlin feels a bit peckish... irritated that he (or
   sometimes, she...) might be getting hungry... that a food supply is not
   immediately at hand. He uses the standard ploy. It always works. Prove 
  that someone is hurting you, about anything. They left their shoes 
  sloppily by the door, they weren't grateful enough, they had the wrong 
  attitude, they didn't smile long enough... gotcha! You asshole! (The 
  switch from Victim to Persecutor is so fast these days it is difficult 
  to tell them apart!) Ahhh! Here comes the Rescuer! An excellent dessert!
   Slurp! Gulp! Gobble! Grunt! Eating someone's life energy is so 
  delicious! Burp! Ahhh! What a nice meal! I feel fine now... I wonder 
  what all that fuss was about... Never mind. It probably won't happen 
  again. Snore... snore.... Huh! Grrrr!!!! I'm awake again! Didn't you 
  notice I was awake? Where's my coffee! It's not hot enough! Grrrrr-argh!
