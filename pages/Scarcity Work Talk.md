- Proposals is a muscle you train
- Scarcity is not something that happens naturally in nature
	- Nature is flow of abundance
	- Scarcity is human creation; modern culture creation
- Game Os and Xs
	- Draw two cardinals (board like tic-tac-toe)
	- Rules of game are purposefully vague:
		- Each sets of 3 Os or 3 Xs gets one point
		- Goal is to see who gets the most points
		- You have 5 minutes
	- How do we behave to play it?
- In scarcity you can't see anything else but the written rules.
	- We get so focused on the rules and how to follow them and we are scared of breaking rules that we don't even understand.
	- There is no rule that says you can't make proposals.

	- Values; studying stories
	- Our fears of the ego don't allow our soul to manifest the abundance in life; ego lives in the 3rd dimension, soul in 4th dimension.
- Box is between you and what is possible.
	- Stuck in scarcity because we are relating with the present stuck in the past; part of your energy is in a space in the past; stuck in your ego.
- The opposite of scarcity is creation.
	- What's holding back is our emotional fears.
	- Feeling fear is resource to creation; resource to abundance.
	- How is it possible that I can use the fear that is holding me back to create?
- "I don't know how to do" -> Fears come up; this is FEELING fear
	- Think fast to deal with some problem
	- Become more creative to resolve problems that appear
- Feeling fear speaking faster -> Fear unconscious
	- If I don't use my fearthen I can avoid responsibility
- Emotional fear -> Is what keeps us in scarity
	- Access conscious fear -> Abundance
