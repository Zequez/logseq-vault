- Proposals is a muscle you train
- Scarcity is not something that happens naturally in nature
	- Nature is flow of abundance
	- Scarcity is human creation; modern culture creation
- Game Os and Xs
	- Draw two cardinals (board like tic-tac-toe)
	- Rules of game are purposefully vague:
		- Each sets of 3 Os or 3 Xs gets one point
		- Goal is to see who gets the most points
		- You have 5 minutes
	- How do we behave to play it?
- In scarcity you can't see anything else but the written rules.
	- We get so focused on the rules and how to follow them and we are scared of breaking rules that we don't even understand.
	- There is no rule that says you can't make proposals.
	- Gremlin is committed to keep us a victim of the system in our story.
		- Some part of you wants to be on scarcity.
		- Fear to get out of scarcity.
			- "I might get excluded from my family in scarcity"
			- "If I live full out I gotta take responsibility"
- We use money to exchange value with each other
	- We plug money into our scarcity [[Thoughtware]]
		- "I don't have enough"

- Gabriela shares her scarcity stories:
	- "If I get out of scarcity I'll leave my family"
	- "If I get out of scarcity I'll live full out"
	- I am the value. The money is a tool that we as human decided to use to exchange value. We use money in our [[Thoughtware]] of scarcity.
		- Modern culture idea "I don't have enough"
			- ...enough money
			- ...enough connection
			- ...enough time
			- ...enough learning
	- Fantasy world "If some day money is not a problem in my life I'll be free"
	- ## Scarcity mechanics
		- People don't have enough because we have holes in our energetic bodies
			- Everything that we receive it does not stays, does not nourishes, because we receive and goes, receive and goes.
				- We don't have the love and care inside of ourselves to just be with what it is, so we're always wanting more and more and more.
		- Emotional holes, emotional scars that keep you distant from the abundance, the creation.

	- Nicole
		- The opposite of scarcity is creation
		- My ability to create is connected to how I'm feeding my 5 bodies
			- If any of my bodies is in pain or malnourished, sun of creation is behind clouds
			- Holes in energetic body
			- Energy draining down the holes
		- When creation is happening I have the experience of ecstasy of "I'm winning"
		- Feeding your 5 bodies does not cost much; that belief is a trap.

	- Values; studying stories
	- Our fears of the ego don't allow our soul to manifest the abundance in life; ego lives in the 3rd dimension, soul in 4th dimension.
- Box is between you and what is possible.
	- Stuck in scarcity because we are relating with the present stuck in the past; part of your energy is in a space in the past; stuck in your ego.
- The opposite of scarcity is creation.
	- What's holding back is our emotional fears.
	- Feeling fear is resource to creation; resource to abundance.
	- How is it possible that I can use the fear that is holding me back to create?
- "I don't know how to do" -> Fears come up; this is FEELING fear
	- Think fast to deal with some problem
	- Become more creative to resolve problems that appear
- Feeling fear speaking faster -> Fear unconscious
	- If I don't use my fearthen I can avoid responsibility
- Emotional fear -> Is what keeps us in scarity
	- Access conscious fear -> Abundance

- Ricardo
	- We have to talk with our feelings
	- We don't identify with the feelings; if we do we become stuck
- Gabriela
	- Shares distinction between the emotional fears that keep you in your box, that you are relating with the present with the past. This fear comes from the past; gets you stuck in you box, does not allow you to create possibilities.
		- Emotional fear that you don't have enough.
	- And the other kind of fear, and invites group to share about moments where they were feeling afraid and became creative.
- Gabriela
	- Shares when I'm talking that I'm numbing fear with joy.
	- Shares that when I'm using fear unconsciously I start to talk faster
	- Some part does not want to use the fear to find solutions because then I need to find responsibility for that.
	- Asked fear what is her next creation, and fear answered that she needed to take things off her schedule.
	- Feelings come up as energy, and if we don't use them they crystalize on emotional body.
	- Use conscious fear to connect to possibilities.

	- Gabriela
		- Proposes 3 minutes to share about scarcity; what is stuck in scarcity in us. Then 5 minutes to the others to give possibilities to that person. Use conscious fear and give possibilities.
