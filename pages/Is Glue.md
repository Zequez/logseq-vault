		- You were born with a large-size tube of 'Is Glue' on your [[Energetic Toolbelt]]. No one needed to explain to you how to use your Is Glue. Everyone uses it, so you use it too.
		  id:: 63294433-fd96-4fa5-b6db-4f37a72e0465
		- The Golden Key for [[Declaring What Is So]] conscious is to make your use of 'Is Glue' conscious.
		- 'Is' does not exist in nature. It is a concoction of the human mind. No other animals use 'Is Glue'.
		  All the kinds of Declaring function by large and - until now - mostly unconscious doses of 'Is Glue'.
