- [[The Money Economy]]
- Community is woven from [[Gift]].
	- Gifts are the warp; [[Stories]] the woof
	- Everybody is in debt with everyone else
	- Disintegration of community
		- It has essentially been strip mined by [[The Money Economy]]; the gift relationships have been turned into goods and services we can buy
	- The more developed a country is the more community is broken down
		- Rural people and the poor tend to have mor community than the affluent.
	- [[Commitment]] to an aim beyond themselves
		- > I propose that that aim should be to repair, regenerate and beautify our hurting planet, to heal its ecological and social trauma. That is something we can all give our gifts toward.
	- "We are in it together"
	- Polarization as a symptom of the breakdown of community
	- You can't have "community" be the motivation for community; there has to be some other aim we are willing to commit to.
	- # We are in this Together
		- "On some level this person is an ally"
