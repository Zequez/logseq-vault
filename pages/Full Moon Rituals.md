- ## Preparing
	- This is the time to let things go. Let go of problems, worries, unwanted
	   behaviour, and toxic people so that you can heal and move forward 
	  without these things holding you back. The Moon’s brightness offers 
	  hope, white celestial light to guide your forward, and confer blessings 
	  from the Moon Goddess Selene.
- ## Affirmations
	- Get ready to cast out those demons (or ex’s). Look at what is really 
	  holding you back – now is the time to let it go. Be honest with yourself
	   and the universe will answer with its help.
	- I release myself from ….
	- I cleanse myself of ….
	- I free myself of ….
	- I forgive myself for ….
	- I let go of my ex
	- I will stop smoking
	- I free myself of needing to be liked
