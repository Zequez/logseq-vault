- ## Description
	- GGFilter was a filterable database of games; gotten mostly from Steam
	- It was in 3 parts, all equally important.
	- The scrapers are bundled in a pure ruby gem with different submodules for each type of scraping: games list, game pages and reviews from Steam, and video cards benchmarks (for the system requirements index).
	- The Rails server works mostly as an API and has the Rake tasks to run the different scrapers on cronjobs.
	- The client is made with React+Redux and it communicates with the server through the API.
