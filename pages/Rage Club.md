- A Telegram group for the [[Team]] is formed.
- Each of us presents themselves in the Telegram group.
- Meet-ups are scheduled; either by online by [[Videoconference]] or physical.
- [[Anger]] is treated as a neutral source of information.
- The purpose is to create a new relationship with Anger.
- The question is asked: "Why is it not OK for me to feel my anger?"
	- Anyone can speak up and say out-loud what comes to their mind with the question.
- [[Clarity]] is precious to other people. Anger brings Clarity.
- Part of the [[Practice]] is to lower our [[Numbness Bar]]. Detect and use Anger earlier rather than when it's on an explosive level.
- Possibility: Use anger to guard a space of calm and serenity
- Synchronously we practice feeling Anger at specific levels with the help of a towel. Then we share how it is for us, what we discover, what we notice. While doing this, the spaceholder holds the space and indicates when to stop.
- Each of us commits to do a 3-3-3 Initiation
	- 3 times per week, for 3 months, 3 minutes of feeling anger
	- We lie down,
