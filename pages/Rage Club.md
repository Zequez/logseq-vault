- A Telegram group for the [[Team]] is formed.
- Each of us presents themselves in the Telegram group.
- Meet-ups are scheduled; either by online by [[Videoconference]] or physical.
- We treat [[Anger]] as a neutral source of information.
- The team create a new relationship with Anger.
- The question is asked: "Why is it not OK for me to feel my anger?"
	- Anyone can speak up and say out-loud what comes to their mind with the question.
- [[Clarity]] is precious to other people. Anger brings Clarity.
