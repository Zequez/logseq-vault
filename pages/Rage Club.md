- A Telegram group for the [[Team]] is formed.
- Meet-ups are scheduled; either online by [[Videoconference]] or by getting together physically.
- ## Introductions
- Each of us introduces ourselves, and then we make note to share the introduction on the Telegram group.
- [[Anger]] is treated as a neutral source of information.
- The purpose is to create a new relationship with Anger.
- The question is asked: "Why is it not OK for me to feel my anger?"
	- Anyone can speak up and say out-loud what comes to their mind with the question.
- [[Clarity]] is precious to other people. Anger brings Clarity.
- Part of the [[Practice]] is to lower our [[Numbness Bar]]. Detect and use Anger earlier rather than when it's on an explosive level.
- Possibility: Use anger to guard a space of calm and serenity
- ## Feeling Anger Consciously
	- Synchronously we practice feeling Anger at specific levels with the help of a towel. Then we share how it is for us, what we discover, what we notice. While doing this, the spaceholder holds the space and indicates when to start and stop the practice.
		- Could a timer be used and have everyone practice, or is it necessary that someone is not doing the practice?

	- Each of us commits to do a 3-3-3 Initiation
		- 3 times per week, for 3 months, 3 minutes of feeling anger
		- We lie down, and practice feeling anger with the help of a towel for 3 minutes
		- We share on the Telegram group that we did the exercise by sending the number "3".
		- We can also share our results from the practice, and get creative with the number 3.
		- We do this for no reason.
	- We take notes on moments of the day that our boundaries were crossed
	- When we start feeling Anger, it cleans up tubes in the nervous system and energetic body that have not been used in a while.
- ## Role Playing Boundary Transgression
	- We get in groups of 3 and take rotating roles:
		- **Client**
			- Allows anger to speak; don't try to remember
				- Anger speaks from the heart; so make sure to check with your heart and try to go back if you realized you are looking up (this means you are looking at your mind; thinking about anger rather than actually feeling it)
			- Picks a person from their life that has transgressed their boundaries
				- They can just pick Dad or Mom and let the anger speak
			- Keep eye contact with the Role-player and let the anger speak
		- **Role-player**
			- With their clicker they declare they are the person that transgressed the Client boundaries.
			- The Role-player stays present, keeps eye contact with the Client, and reflects back what the other person says.
				- With [[Completion Loops]]?

		- **Coach**
			- Offers possibilities and gives feedback; mostly to the Client.
			- Is the spaceholder
				- Is this correct? But then the Role-player is the spaceholder is the coach is not there? Could all people hold the space? I'm not even sure I understand what holding space feels like.

	- As anger surfaces we distill the boundary; which means, we put the boundary into precise words that in the situation are said to the other person as a declaration.
	- Setting boundaries is skill that can be improved with [[Practice]]
