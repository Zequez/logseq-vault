- ## Description
	- FactorioMods was a fan-made web app made on Rails to host Factorio mods (Factorio is a videogame).
	- The backend was made on Rails and the front end wasn't anything fancy in the JS department, although the CSS was made from scratch (with SASS).
	- After I published the app I got contracted officially by the Factorio team to make an official API and web portal, although they wanted the backend to be done with a Python. In the new web app, which now lives in https://mods.factorio.com/ the front end is entirely made on React, to take advantage of the API backend.
	- The old web app is no longer available, and I'm not involved anymore on their official portal.
	- However, the original source code is available on Github.
