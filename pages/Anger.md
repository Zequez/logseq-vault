- Conscious Anger
	- Too often we ask "What can I do?" instead of asking "What needs to be done?"
		- We need to start asking "What needs to be done, and then we need to start doing it"
	- Radical Honestly
		- The lie is a fundamental element of storytelling and one of the most common driving forces for conflict.
		- You have two people withhold a piece of information from the other, and you got a pretty basic recipe for dramatic tension.
		- Brad Blanton
			- We all lie like Hell
			- It wears us out.
			- It is the major source of all human stress
			- Lying kills people.
