- Conscious Anger
	- Too often we ask "What can I do?" instead of asking "What needs to be done?"
		- We need to start asking "What needs to be done, and then we need to start doing it"
	- Radical Honestly
		- The lie is a fundamental element of storytelling and one of the most common driving forces for conflict.
		- You have two people withhold a piece of information from the other, and you got a pretty basic recipe for dramatic tension.
		- Brad Blanton
			- We all lie like Hell
			- It wears us out.
			- It is the major source of all human stress
			- Lying kills people.
			- People being too hard on themselves when they don't live up to their own images of how others think they should act.
				- We don't know who we are and we try to guess who we have to be in order to do the right thing and be happy
					- We get lost in the process and beat the hell out of ourselves before we even know we are hurt
		- Level 1: Revealing the facts; confess everything you have hidden. Un-tell those lies.
		- Level 2: Honestly expressing feelings and thoughts
		- Level 3: Demythologizing ourselves. Who we are is not who we have been pretending to be. We admit we don't really know who we are.
