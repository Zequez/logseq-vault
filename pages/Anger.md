- Conscious Anger
	- Too often we ask "What can I do?" instead of asking "What needs to be done?"
		- We need to start asking "What needs to be done, and then we need to start doing it"
	- Radical Honestly

		- The lie is a fundamental element of storytelling and one of the most common driving forces for conflict.
		- You have two people withhold a piece of information from the other, and you got a pretty basic recipe for dramatic tension.
		- Brad Blanton
			- We all lie like Hell
			- It wears us out.
			- It is the major source of all human stress
			- Lying kills people.
			- People being too hard on themselves when they don't live up to their own images of how others think they should act.
				- We don't know who we are and we try to guess who we have to be in order to do the right thing and be happy
					- We get lost in the process and beat the hell out of ourselves before we even know we are hurt
		- Level 1: Revealing the facts; confess everything you have hidden. Un-tell those lies.
		- Level 2: Honestly expressing feelings and thoughts
		- Level 3: Demythologizing ourselves. Who we are is not who we have been pretending to be. We admit we don't really know who we are.
			- Admit all the things that in your false modesty pretending that you didn't care about (like you don't really want money!)
			- If you don't truly embarrass yourself from all you have to say about about yourself then you don't truly know shit from "shmola?" about transformation.
		- Purpose
			- Not a path to absolute self-trascendence
			- A path to deeper self intimacy
			- A lie is a wall
				- Only being more honest can we break down this walls
			- A person capable of intimacy means a person capable of telling the truth
				- Still has roles to play, but is no longer trapped in them
				- The person is then in charge rather than the role
- Unconscious Anger
	- If you gossip or criticise someone's behaviour behind their back
	- If you break a promise that you intended to keep
	- If you are struggling to do your best without getting any results; try and find those you are trying to please; you are probably angry at them
	- If you are a perfectionist that nothing is good enough
	- We get angry at people for dying
