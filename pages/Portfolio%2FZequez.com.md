- ## Description
- This used to be my first personal blog, and portfolio. Although I didn't really write too much, I just published all my projects, big or small.
- The blog itself was a static website made with Middleman, hosted on Github pages. It's a pretty simple design made by me.
- Still online for archiving purposes, but outdated.
