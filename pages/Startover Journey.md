		- Going by Anger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njhO_YJ6zWU
			- Anger in our culture is a problem. This interview shows a new possibility how to go with anger. How to see its qualities. Clarity, integrity. The ability to say Yes or No. To make desicions. To go or to stay. And to find an end.

			- **Slow Down**: In
			   all the zombie movies I've watched (there aren't that many), the 
			  zombies move exceptionally slowly. Perhaps it's related to the fact that
			   they no longer have a connection to the emotional, energetic, 
			  intellectual and archetypal body, but the physical body alone acts. 
			  Without anger, fear, sadness or joy from the emotional body, a zombie 
			  can change its speed badly. It runs towards its target like a dead 
			  machine.
			  So this experiment is about turning down the speed completely for a whole day.
			  Do
			   everything very slowly and calmly and quietly that day. Even if you are
			   not a zombie and have connection to your feelings and energetic body, 
			  turn down the speed a lot. Even in the morning in bed, open your eyelids
			   very slowly and get up slowly. Speak slowly too, stretching words out 
			  like chewing gum. How far can you push this until fear arises? What 
			  reactions do you get from those around you? Who speaks to you? Observe 
			  where in your body the greatest resistance to slowness is. Is it your 
			  legs? Your speech? Is it in your interactions with others that you have 
			  the most difficulty? Try thinking slower, too. Imagine thoughts slowly 
			  trickling down like a stone through thick honey.
			  The point here is 
			  not to slip into the zombie role like an actor. It's about exploring 
			  slowness. What's happening in your emotional body? Maybe one of the four
			   feelings benefits from slowness? How fast is sadness compared to 
			  anxiety?
			  At night, write in your BEEP!Book what happened in your 
			  emotional body. Describe this individually for each feeling and emotion.
			   What did you observe, is there a feeling that became more present in 
			  the slowness?
			  Also write out the effects on your 5 bodies. What did 
			  you notice in the physical, intellectual, emotional, energetic and 
			  archetypal bodies?

			- In South Africa, 'sawubona' is the Zulu word for 'hello'. There's a beautiful and powerful intention behind that word because 'sawubona' literally translated means, "I see you, and by seeing you, I bring you into being."
			- The Experiment is for this week (and perhaps for the rest of your life) greet people by saying, "Sawubona," instead of saying, "Hello. How are you?"
			- PROBLEM: You know what this word means and the other person does not. Therefore you must make special efforts so that your Gremlin does not use this as a way of shocking people, being weird or different. Instead be vulnerable by immediately defining the word and saying why you are using it.
