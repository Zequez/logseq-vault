- It's a weird 
  thing to talk about Vision. Vision is something you see with your mind's
   eye. The implication is that it is a visual experience. You 'see' it. 
  But you don't. Where does Vision come from? Why do some people seem to 
  have Vision and some do not? When someone has Vision, they seem 
  Inspired, they move through obstacles like they were stepping stones. 
  Vision can be blurred and waylaid by distracting or interfering 
  elements, whereas Inspiration is less so. Inspiration can still move 
  things forward even if there is no Vision about exactly how it should go
   or should look. In Possibility Management it is recognized that 
  "Clarity ignites unquenchable Inspiration." The mechanism of becoming 
  Inspired is revealed: first get Clarity. Distinctions create Clarity. 
  Clarity creates Inspiration. Being able to deliver a clear and powerful 
  Vision can provide the Clarity that ignites unquenchable Inspiration. 
  Landing Vision requires skillful Story telling. (See: Clarity, 
  Distinction, Stories)
