- This is something that happened. That's all I can say.
- ## First Scene
	- Team! I just had a discovery! I just had started to feel emotional anger after I remembered that an amazing idea I just got was actually just something that someone else was already working on (who now I realize I don't see as being part of my team).
	- Long story short, I was letting my anger get bigger, and my son is asleep just in the next room so I couldn't scream in anger. I started to just scream in silence while standing up and felt as if I was acting on an angry caricature mad scientist.
	- Then after the above realization I felt the anger of "YES! I LOVE THAT! YES! YES!" and again I turned into a character, this time a CEO absolutely excited about what his team had done.
	- Then I experimented again by feeling angry for no reason and I turned into Goku (From Dragon Ball) when its charging a super ball of energy and again felt amazing.
	- Then I tried to recreate the YES anger but it turned evil, I think I might be mixing it with joy when I do that.
- I did the anger for no reason and felt like Goku again.
	- Then I tried to re-do the YES anger experiment and again I mixed it with joy. I turned into a sadist looking into a bug being dismembered.
	- Then as I was about to do another experiment with anger, my partner came out and my anger immediately retreated replaced with fear.
- ## Second Scene
	- After a [[Very Upsetting Conversation]] she proceeds to go to [[My Room]], pick a sort of shovel from the tools storage, and go to the bathroom,  pick up 3 little poops that I had left in the toilet and throw them, shovel and all, into the middle of the living room and proceed to invite me into cleaning it up, which I haven't done yet, but which I feel drawn to avoid another of her "tantrums?".
- Then as I was left alone again in the kitchen, my anger came back in a wave of emotion that felt like someone (after trying to contain it for a few seconds) screaming "I LIVE WITH A FUCKING CHILD!" and collapsing to the floor. Like someone being absolutely frustrated by the absolute irrationality of someone.
- Now sadness came up and I realized that what I saw was she was _acting out_ her anger unconsciously (Low Drama?).
  I felt joy from seeing this, but it was a sort of joy of laughing about the situation, as if in telling it to a group of friends as a funny anecdote (unconscious joy?). But I'm actually scared to talk to her about it.
- Ok there is more. There was more emotional sadness about it, felt like a child that was acting sad so her mother would stop being angry at her. Like a strong signal to drop it, to drop the act, it's really hurting.
  Then I felt inspired by this and attempted to feel sad intentionally, but it was mixed with fear and it felt more like a startled <fill word> autistic child?, screaming in crouching in the floor curled up with arms over head.
  As I could not "remember" the word for that I felt emotional anger. The anger was completely directed towards my head area, as if the brain was responsible for this _devastating_ situation (thinking maybe a portal from school?)
