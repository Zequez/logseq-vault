- Electric network inside human beings [[Physical Body]] that resonates in different frequencies as it interacts with life.
- The Nervous System can be overstimulated and it needs downtime to recover, as a muscle being exercised.
- The Nervous System also needs non-human stimulation, such as resonating with trees, bees, the ocean, the rivers, and [[Gaia]].
- Stimulation of the Nervous System in nature is on a completely different time system, a different frequency. It can be much slower, and it can be fast too.
