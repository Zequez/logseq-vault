title:: Offering: Custom Bubble In The Bubble Website

- I'm offering the [[Possibility]] of having your own personal website based on your [[LogSeq]] notes and published online with a custom design.
- To do this the process is still a little rough and technical so I'm offering the possibility to guide you through setting up the system and using the tools.
- The essence is the following:
	- Install LogSeq in your computer
	- Install LogSeq web publishing to your computer
	- Setup a Github account to host your web for free
	- Get yourself a domain name if you don't already have one
	- Setup the domain name to point to Github
