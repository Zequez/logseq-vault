- ## Money Story as a Victim
	- I am born to a family of father, mother and a brother
	- When I was a kid my father got all the money in the house. He would work long hours and come back at night. I was told studying is my only job. And my father made sure we did the job well, by paying us for getting good grades.
	- He also payed us to do things that we otherwise wouldn't do, like picking up dog poop.
	- With the money saved, I remember having bought a fishing rod; fishing was an activity that we did together with my father; not very often, but yes.
