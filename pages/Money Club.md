- ## Money Story as a Victim
	- I am born to a family of father, mother and a brother
	- When I was a kid my father got all the money in the house. He would work long hours and come back at night. I was told studying is my only job. And my father, _in his attempt to control us_,  made sure we did the job well, by paying us for getting good grades. And punishing us (by taking computer time away) if we got bad grades.
	- He also payed us to do things that we otherwise wouldn't do, like picking up dog poop. He was teaching us to do things we didn't want for money.
	- With the money saved, I remember having bought a fishing rod; fishing was an activity that we did together with my father; although not very often.
	- There was a lot of worry about money in my home. I was born in an economically unstable country. On 2001 there was an economic crisis that left my parents with big debts and empty savings. Menem and he peronists had stolen all the money in the country by their _neoliberalismo_ idea.
