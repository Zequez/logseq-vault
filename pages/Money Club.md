- ## Money Story as a Victim
	- Experiment: Tell Your Money Story as a Victim Story
	  collapsed:: true
		- On paper, in a digital document, or by recording yourself (audio or video), tell your Money [Story](https://storyworld.mystrikingly.com/)
		   as a victim story. Consciously ham it up so that it is a story of woe 
		  and suffering. Use worlds like 'always' and 'never'. Make persecutors 
		  out of as many people or institutions as possible, and out of any 
		  rescuers who failed to rescue you properly.
		  
		  Read it out loud to yourself, or listen to or watch the recording.
		  
		  Notice how you feel from telling and witnessing your story this way, and make a record of this, too. Make special note of any emotions that you feel, and use them for the next experiment.
	- I am born to a family of father, mother and a brother. We weren't rich, but we weren't poor either. The home was big, some kids that came to our home thought we were rich, other thought we were like them. I didn't think we were rich.
	- When I was a kid my father hammered down the importance of money of us by disappearing the whole day and coming back at night with money that he would give us so we could put on a tin (to save it). That was his job, being somewhere else and getting money.
	- I was told studying is my only job. And my father, _in his attempt to control us_,  made sure we did the job well, by paying us for getting good grades. And punishing us (by taking computer time away) if we got bad grades.
	- Once we were hooked on money, he would give it to us to do things we didn't want to do, like picking up dog poop from the garden.
	- When I saved enough money, I remember having bought a fishing rod; we didn't even went fishing that much, but it was something we did together with my father.
	- Somewhere along my childhood, I discovered what it meant to be rich. A wealthy great-aunt, the wealthiest of the family, took my brother and I to a toy store and told us to pick one item, whatever we wanted. So being rich meant not bothering oneself about the price of things. This was not how we did things at our family, the price of things was always somethings to be worried about.
	- And prices always went up all the time. I was born in an economically unstable country and inflation was and is an everyday thing. On 2001 there was an economic crisis that left my parents with big debts and empty savings. Menem and the Peronist party had stolen all the money in the country and made us all poor with their _neoliberalismo_ idea that failed miserably.
	- At some point during a summer when I was a kid I made an attempt at entrepreneurship. I created a sort of play-doh kit to sell to parents for their children. So after having build some of these, I walked on the beach and offered it to a group of people. I got rejected. That was the last time I ever tried to sell something to someone. The kits were left at home in a forgotten corner.
	- In my adolescence my father suddenly got very interested in investing, after having read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. I ended up reading the book too. And he even bought some board games based on that book to learn by playing. What I got from all that was the following: don't be an employee, have things that make money for you. So that started my long failed career to make things that made money for me and my years of resented employment.
	- I've known how to make websites since I was 14 years old. I'm 29 right now and worked professionally as a web developer for many years. In all those years my focus has been to "create something that made money". I never tried to sell a website to anyone. But I did end up working as an employee or contractor for many companies.
		- The idea was to make something so popular that I could just put Google Adsense and get let the cash flow to me. So basically a big advertising thing; let Google sell for me. Now I hate advertisement so that's not an option either.
	- So since I couldn't sell any creation to anyone out of the fear of being rejected, I sold what I was taught to sell in my childhood, my time. I created what I was told to create, that way I wouldn't get rejected.
	- Fast forward to early adulthood; my web development path took me many places. As it turns out learning to program on the Internet shoves you into learning English too. So as a bilingual web developer I was in a privileged position for global remote employment. After a failed project that got the attention of a local software-factory company, I got hired by them. This put me on a path of ever-increasing income from my craft. I was paid by the hour worked and over the years it went from 5-10USD per hour to about 45 USD per hour on my last job. Always creating things I don't resonate with for people that control me with money.
	- Right now my last employment facade (I was invited in the premise )
