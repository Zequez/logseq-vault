- ## Money Story as a Victim
	- Experiment: Tell Your Money Story as a Victim Story
	  collapsed:: true
		- On paper, in a digital document, or by recording yourself (audio or video), tell your Money [Story](https://storyworld.mystrikingly.com/)
		   as a victim story. Consciously ham it up so that it is a story of woe 
		  and suffering. Use worlds like 'always' and 'never'. Make persecutors 
		  out of as many people or institutions as possible, and out of any 
		  rescuers who failed to rescue you properly.
		  
		  Read it out loud to yourself, or listen to or watch the recording.
		  
		  Notice how you feel from telling and witnessing your story this way, and make a record of this, too. Make special note of any emotions that you feel, and use them for the next experiment.
	- I am born to a family of father, mother and a brother. We weren't rich, but we weren't poor either. The home was big, some kids that came to our home thought we were rich, other thought we were like them. I didn't think we were rich.
	- When I was a kid my father hammered down the importance of money of us by disappearing the whole day and coming back at night with money that he would give us so we could put on a tin (to save it). That was his job, being somewhere else and getting money.
	- I was told studying is my only job. And my father, _in his attempt to control us_,  made sure we did the job well, by paying us for getting good grades. And punishing us (by taking computer time away) if we got bad grades.
	- Once we were kho He also payed us to do things that we otherwise wouldn't do, like picking up dog poop. He was teaching us to do things we didn't want for money.
	- With the money saved, I remember having bought a fishing rod; fishing was an activity that we did together with my father; although not very often.
	- There was a lot of worry about money in my home. I was born in an economically unstable country. On 2001 there was an economic crisis that left my parents with big debts and empty savings. Menem and he peronists had stolen all the money in the country and made us all poor with their _neoliberalismo_ idea.
