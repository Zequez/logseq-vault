title:: Unblock Third Eye

-
- Ability to perceive beyond the limitations of this reality. Regulates the ability of [[Vision]].
- Center for clairvoyance, or clear vision. Perceive the dimensions beyond the physical realm
- Pinal gland; pitutary gland.
	- Project us into any reality
- Seat of the soul.
- Ark of the Covenant
	- Time travel
	- Cavities in brain have occult function
		- Antennas receive and transmit waveforms
	- Activity comes to a peak here.
- We are time traveling as we speak. Central nervous system locates us in space and time. Our bodies are our astronaut suit.
- Mysticism esoteric
- Religion exoteric
- Religion pulls from mysticism while oppressing the practice. It's never been safe to be in our intuitive abilities; in the past we suffered severe repercussions for activating those centers.
- Our abilities of activate it depends on how safe we feel.
- We might be wanting ability that we are afraid of. Fear is shutting down third eye system.
- We come with Third Eye open; but not fully activated; not fully realized.

- Rational mind acts as a barrier.
- Intellect is overpowering Intuition. The Intellectual Body is overpowering the Emotional / Energetic / Physical Body. The Masculine Part of Our Brain is overpowering the Feminine Part of Our Brain.
- Third eye is activated through the equilibrium of these 2 hemispheres. Either way we are unbalanced (either one overpowering the other), and won't be able to create the equilibrium that takes the Third Eye to open.
- In the intellect driven world of [[Patriarchy]] the [[Masculine]] hemisphere is overpowering the [[Femenine]] one. Our Intellect is overpowering our Intuition.
- To balance this situation we don't need to get rid of our Intellectual abilities; but rather start to notice when it's being used to [[Control and Regulate]] our intuitive abilities.
	- We doubt that we are having mystical experiences; because they are not as vivid as we expect them to be. But we need to validate the Third Eye exactly as it shows up; this is how to train the center to feel safe enough to continue to be activated.
	- We are experts at gaslighting ourselves.
	- Third eye activity might not be super prominent and vivid:
		- Dream activity
		- Inner visualization
		- A screen inside the mind eye holding some some of scenery at play
	- However you receive it; validate it; honor it as important information that you are communicating to yourself.
- Not everyone will experience Clairvoyance at the same level; based on their soul journey and depending on their soul contracts.

- Most powerful way to unleash this center is to raise our level of consciousness at that of Onness.  It's all part of the same process of balancing our hemispheres.
- Empathicness is experiencing Onness. [[Emotional Body]] innate wisdom that we are all interconnected. So if we feel empathy, we're halfway there to Onness; even if our conscious hasn't merged with our unconscious, and our intellect hasn't balanced with our intuition.
- The energy of this age is supportive of our raising of consciousness into Onness.

- Belief system within the center. Under the belief that has been abandoned
