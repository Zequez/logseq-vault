- ## Letter for team
	- Hello team! This idea has been consolidating in my mind for a few weeks already and I'm turned on about it. I want to get your perspective to see if it's of any value. For me the value is creating team collaboration possibilities by creating a digital space where team members can co-create and play with their information.
	- Here is a test proposal for what I'm being called to create:
		- I'm proposing to create for your own team or gameworld a digital toolbox for collaboratively sharing information and co-creating a team website and gameworld gameboard.
			- It works like this:
				- An editable web form (Google Forms) is created that each member maintain with a set questions that would be useful for the purpose of the gameworld you are playing at, sort of like a character sheet in a game
				- The answers get recorded and are available to every team member on a spreadsheet (Google Sheets)
					- The spreadsheet can be played around with to create a sort of gameboard
				- Additionally, the spreadsheet data will be used as source to generate a customizable website that acts as a sort of visual team page.
					- Further down the line this can be enhanced with a monitoring system that keeps track of what's up with the team and highlights updates to their linked public online activity.
			- For example for an hypothetical PM Language Exchange Gameworld these [forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc81lzTXTC5GSE9IIItYRR97TEg0PyI0slpgIiSKsKdSiSCwg/viewform) and [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vvb_znZfMiKrn9P5XimRUdE8yifTuunzjTGKFkFpjB8/edit#gid=1262274810) were created, where each member is asked what languages they want to practice, what language they are competent at, their time availability, if they've already found a partner, and experiments they would like to propose. With this, I believe new possibilities open up for play that are not available on just having Telegram as a team hub. Telegram would still be a vital part of the team tool system.
		- I also need some things for my next steps, so part of the proposal is to ask for collaboration.
			- I don't want to charge for the system itself. Digital tools are essentially free and I don't believe in creating artificial scarcity. So I want to automate the digital system as much as possible, and create detailed instructions on how to do this.
			- However for the web system there is some maintenance costs that I would take responsibility for, and by supporting me you enable everyone on the wider community to have their own team page and gameworld board for free.
			- "Commit to my commitment to steward this Gameworld by supporting my next steps in Patreon/Ko-fi/Paypal/etc"
				- Maybe for Patreons I can offer 1-1 assistance to co-create with these tools? Even the tech skills?
				- If I'm taking request for creating or customizing boards/pages then a rule could be that the highest paying Patreons could be on higher priority?
				- I would also be open to receive other form of value
		- What do you think/feel about this?
