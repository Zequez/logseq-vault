- Hello team! This idea has been consolidating in my mind for a few days already and I feel turned on about it, and I want to get feedback. Here is how a proposal for what I'm called to create would look like:
	- I'm proposing to create for your own team or gameworld a digital toolbox for collaboratively sharing information and co-creating a team website.
		- It works like this:
			- An editable web form (Google Forms) is created that each member maintain with a set questions that would be useful for the purpose of the gameworld you are playing at, sort of like a character sheet in a game
			- The answers get recorded and are available to every team member on a spreadsheet (Google Sheets)
				- The spreadsheet can be played around with to create a sort of gameboard
			- Additionally, the spreadsheet data will be used as source to generate a customizable website that acts as a sort of visual team page.
				- Further down the line this can be enhanced with a monitoring system that keeps track of what's up with the team and highlights updates to their linked public online activity.
		- For example for an hypothetical PM Language Exchange Gameworld these forms and spreadsheets were created
