- Hello team! This idea has been consolidating in my mind for a few days already and I'm turned on about it, and I want to get your perspective to see if it's of any value. Here is how a proposal for what I'm called to create would look like:
	- I'm proposing to create for your own team or gameworld a digital toolbox for collaboratively sharing information and co-creating a team website.

	- Now, this requires the work of creating the spreadsheets and forms which can easily be taught; and then the website generation system would also need some extra work that I'm capable of doing. I see this whole thing as a Gameworld of itself where the value is that of enhancing team collaboration by creating a
