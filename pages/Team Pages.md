- Hello team! This idea has been consolidating in my mind for a few days already and I feel turned on about it, and I want to get feedback. Here is how a proposal for what I'm called to create would look like:
	- I'm proposing to create for your own team or gameworld a digital toolbox for collaboratively sharing information and co-creating a team website.
		- It works like this:
			- - An editable Google Form is created for the team or gameworld with set questions that would be useful for the purpose of the gameworld you are playing
