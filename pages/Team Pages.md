- Hello team! This idea has been consolidating in my mind for a few days already and I'm turned on about it. I want to get your perspective to see if it's of any value. Here is how a proposal for what I'm called to create would look like:
	- I'm proposing to create for your own team or gameworld a digital toolbox for collaboratively sharing information and co-creating a team website and gameworld gameboard.
		- It works like this:
			- An editable web form (Google Forms) is created that each member maintain with a set questions that would be useful for the purpose of the gameworld you are playing at, sort of like a character sheet in a game
			- The answers get recorded and are available to every team member on a spreadsheet (Google Sheets)
				- The spreadsheet can be played around with to create a sort of gameboard
			- Additionally, the spreadsheet data will be used as source to generate a customizable website that acts as a sort of visual team page.
				- Further down the line this can be enhanced with a monitoring system that keeps track of what's up with the team and highlights updates to their linked public online activity.
		- For example for an hypothetical PM Language Exchange Gameworld these [forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc81lzTXTC5GSE9IIItYRR97TEg0PyI0slpgIiSKsKdSiSCwg/viewform) and [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vvb_znZfMiKrn9P5XimRUdE8yifTuunzjTGKFkFpjB8/edit#gid=1262274810) were created, where each member is asked what languages they want to practice, what language they are competent at, their time availability, if they've already found a partner, and experiments they would like to propose. With this, I believe new possibilities open up for play that are not available on just having Telegram as a team hub. Telegram would still be a vital part of the team tool system.
	- For me the value is that of enhancing team collaboration by creating a space where a team can co-create and play with their information.
	- I want to use this to fund my next steps, so part of the proposal is to ask for collaboration.
		- I don't want to charge for the system itself. Digital tools are essentially free and I don't believe in creating artificial scarcity. So I want to automate the digital system as much as possible, and create detailed instructions on how to do this.
		- However for the web system there is some maintenance costs that I would take responsibility for.
		- And it's true that if many people want their team page customized I would need to prioritize.
		-
	-
	- Now, this requires the work of creating the spreadsheets and forms (which is quite easy); and then the website generation system (which requires some technical skills but can be seen as an opportunity to learn the essential web tech skills and can be co-created online with some tools) would also need some extra work that I'm capable of doing. I see this whole thing as a Gameworld of itself where the value is that of enhancing team collaboration by creating a  space where team can co-create with their information.
