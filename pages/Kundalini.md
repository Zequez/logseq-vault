- A creative feminine energy.
- Kundalini energy is the one that creates a new being during sex.
- Depicted as a coiled snake.
- The energy does not dissipate, it stays in the root chakra.
- A yogi can, instead of having it be used only on sexual play; it can make it ascend the spine, it becomes a spiritual creative energy just as it becomes a physically creative energy through sex.
- If the Kundalini ascension happens too quickly it can overwhelm the person.
