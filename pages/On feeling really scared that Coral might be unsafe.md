- DAMN! I just heard [[Coral]] cry next door while playing with Celeste. And there is a strong [[Fear]] there.
- I'm feeling [[Anger]] about things that make Coral unsafe.
- Is this being angry at the fear? What does it mean?
	- I'm afraid of being alone and afraid.
	- Ok who do I become now then?
	- I'm happy to finally be able to feel my fear again.
	- I'm a [[Feeler]].
