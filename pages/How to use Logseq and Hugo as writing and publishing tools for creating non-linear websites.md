	- Create pages outside a hierarchical structure
	- Links pages with each other effortlessly as you write
	- Export pages to be used on as Hugo pages

- This is actually an experiment because I don't know how to actually do this yet.
	- Put Hugo directory inside Logseq vault
	- Install Hugo template
	- Attempt to load Logseq posts from Hugo directly
		- Modify posts so that they load correctly on Hugo?
	- Link posts by following links; backlinks posts too
	- Add creation and editing date to post
	- Load journal pages into Hugo
	- Create welcome page to site on LogSeq; use as Index
	- Customize theme to what I actually want
	- Publish on Github Pages as replacement of my current site at zequez.space
	- Share on Possibility Village; ask for feedback and proposals.
