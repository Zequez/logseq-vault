- I'm a New Internet Coach from Archearchy. Experimenter. Apprentice 
  Possibilitator and Mage.
- I'm work for Team Gaia.
- I'm a New Refugee from patriarchal culture. I started my authentic 
  adulthood initiatory path after discovering Startover from researching 
  ecovillaging at GEN, and I've been mostly exploring, reading and doing 
  experiments by myself for a few months.
- My next steps are to experience Expand The Box, Emotional Healing 
  Proccesses, Rage Club, Fear Club, Gremlin Transformation Workshops, 
  Money Club, distilling my Bright Principles, Stellating my feelings, 
  learning interspecies communication, space-holding, space-navigating, 
  ecovillaging and who knows what other Next-Culture skills or workshops 
  that I don't know about or don't even exist yet.
- I'm co-creating the New Internet and making it accessible to everyone.
