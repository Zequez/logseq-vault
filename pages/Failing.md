- Failing = [[Feedback]]
- When you try to change someone else you might fail; the Feedback could be a simple "Fuck you".
- Failure is an event, not a person.
- Don't call it failing, call it learning.
- Failing is a perspective.
- > “I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” - Michael Jordan
- Failure is only the opportunity to begin again, only this time more wisely.
- Failure is an essential part of [[Experimenting]]
